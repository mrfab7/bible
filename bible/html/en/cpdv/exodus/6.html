<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the Lord said to Moses: “Now you will see what I shall do to Pharaoh. For through a strong hand he will release them, and by a mighty hand he will cast them from his land.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: “I am the Lord,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">who appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as Almighty God. And I did not reveal to them my name: ADONAI.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And I formed a covenant with them, in order to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojourning, in which they were newcomers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I have heard the groaning of the sons of Israel, with which the Egyptians have oppressed them. And I have remembered my covenant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For this reason, say to the sons of Israel: I am the Lord who will lead you away from the work house of the Egyptians, and rescue you from servitude, and also redeem you with an exalted arm and great judgments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And I will take you to myself as my people, and I will be your God. And you will know that I am the Lord your God, who led you away from the work house of the Egyptians,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">and who brought you into the land, over which I lifted up my hand in order to grant it to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And I will grant it to you as a possession. I am the Lord.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And so, Moses explained all these things to the sons of Israel, who did not agree with him, because of their anguish of spirit and very difficult work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">“Enter and speak to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, so that he may release the sons of Israel from his land.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Moses responded in the sight the Lord: “Behold, the sons of Israel do not listen to me. And how will Pharaoh listen to me, especially since I am of uncircumcised lips?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, and he gave them a commandment for the sons of Israel, and for Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, that they should lead the sons of Israel away from the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">These are the leaders of the houses by their families. The sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">These are the kindred of Reuben. The sons of Simeon: Jemuel and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite women. These are the progeny of Simeon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And these are the names of the sons of Levi by their kindred: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari. Now the years of the life of Levi were one hundred and thirty-seven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, by their kindred.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The sons of Kohath: Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron and Uzziel. Likewise, the years of the life of Kohath were one hundred and thirty-three.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the kindred of Levi by their families.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Now Amram took as a wife Jochebed, his paternal aunt, who bore for him Aaron and Moses. And the years of the life of Amram were one hundred and thirty-seven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Likewise, the sons of Izhar: Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Likewise, the sons of Uzziel: Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Sithri.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Now Aaron took as a wife Elizabeth, the daughter of Amminadab, sister of Nahshon, who bore for him Nadab, and Abihu, and Eleazar, and Ithamar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Likewise, the sons of Korah: Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph. These are the kindred of the Korahites.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And truly Eleazar, the son of Aaron, took a wife from the daughters of Putiel. And she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the Levitical families by their kindred.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">These are Aaron and Moses, whom the Lord instructed to lead the sons of Israel away from the land of Egypt by their companies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">These are those who speak to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, in order to lead the sons of Israel out of Egypt. These are Moses and Aaron,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">in the day when the Lord spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: “I am the Lord. Speak to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, all that I speak to you.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And Moses said in the sight of the Lord: “Lo, I am of uncircumcised lips, how will Pharaoh listen to me?”</p>
