  <verse number="1">THESE things Jesus spoke, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said: Father, the hour is come, glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee.</verse>
  <verse number="2">As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he may give eternal life to all whom thou hast given him.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Now this is eternal life: That they may know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I have glorified thee on the earth; I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And now glorify thou me, O Father, with thyself, with the glory which I had, before the world was, with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="6">I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou hast given me out of the world. Thine they were, and to me thou gavest them; and they have kept thy word.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Now they have known, that all things which thou hast given me, are from thee:</verse>
  <verse number="8">Because the words which thou gavest me, I have given to them; and they have received them, and have known in very deed that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.</verse>
  <verse number="9">I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them whom thou hast given me: because they are thine:</verse>
  <verse number="10">And all my things are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And now I am not in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep them in thy name whom thou has given me; that they may be one, as we also are.</verse>
  <verse number="12">While I was with them, I kept them in thy name. Those whom thou gavest me have I kept; and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition, that the scripture may be fulfilled.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And now I come to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy filled in themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I have given them thy word, and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world; as I also am not of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I pray not that thou shouldst take them out of the world, but that thou shouldst keep them from evil.</verse>
  <verse number="16">They are not of the world, as I also am not of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Sanctify them in truth. Thy word is truth.</verse>
  <verse number="18">As thou hast sent me into the world, I also have sent them into the world.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And for them do I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified in truth.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And not for them only do I pray, but for them also who through their word shall believe in me;</verse>
  <verse number="21">That they all may be one, as thou, Father, in me, and I in thee; that they also may be one in us; that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the glory which thou hast given me, I have given to them; that they may be one, as we also are one:</verse>
  <verse number="23">I in them, and thou in me; that they may be made perfect in one: and the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast also loved me.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Father, I will that where I am, they also whom thou hast given me may be with me; that they may see my glory which thou hast given me, because thou hast loved me before the creation of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Just Father, the world hath not known thee; but I have known thee: and these have known that thou hast sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And I have made known thy name to them, and will make it known; that the love wherewith thou hast loved me, may be in them, and I in them.</verse>
