<chapter book="Job" number="23" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And Job answereth and saith:—</verse>
  <verse number="2">Also—to-day is my complaint bitter, My hand hath been heavy because of my sighing.</verse>
  <verse number="3">O that I had known—and I find Him, I come in unto His seat,</verse>
  <verse number="4">I arrange before Him the cause, And my mouth fill with arguments.</verse>
  <verse number="5">I know the words He doth answer me, And understand what He saith to me.</verse>
  <verse number="6">In the abundance of power doth He strive with me? No! surely He putteth it in me.</verse>
  <verse number="7">There the upright doth reason with Him, And I escape for ever from my judge.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Lo, forward I go—and He is not, And backward—and I perceive him not.</verse>
  <verse number="9">To the left in His working—and I see not, He is covered on the right, and I behold not.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For He hath known the way with me, He hath tried me—as gold I go forth.</verse>
  <verse number="11">On His step hath my foot laid hold, His way I have kept, and turn not aside,</verse>
  <verse number="12">The command of His lips, and I depart not. Above my allotted portion I have laid up The sayings of His mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And He is in one mind, And who doth turn Him back? And His soul hath desired—and He doth it.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For He doth complete my portion, And many such things are with Him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Therefore, from His presence I am troubled, I consider, and am afraid of Him.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And God hath made my heart soft, And the Mighty hath troubled me.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For I have not been cut off before darkness, And before me He covered thick darkness.</verse>
