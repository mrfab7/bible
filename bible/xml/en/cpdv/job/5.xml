  <verse number="1">Therefore call, if there are any who will respond to you, and turn to one or another of the saints.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Truly, anger condemns the foolish to death, and envy kills the petty.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I have seen a fool with a strong root, and I have cursed his excellence without hesitation.</verse>
  <verse number="4">His sons will be far from prosperity and will be crushed at the gate, and there will be none who can rescue them.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Their harvest, the starving will eat. The armed man will rob him, and the thirsty will drink his resources.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Nothing on earth occurs without a reason, and sorrow does not rise from the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Man is born to labor, and the bird to fly.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Therefore, because of this, I will beg the Lord, and place my eloquence before God.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He does great and unfathomable and miraculous things without number.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He gives rain over the face of the earth and irrigates all things with the waters.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He places the humble on high and encourages the grieving towards health.</verse>
  <verse number="12">He dispels the thoughts of the spiteful, lest their hands be able to complete what they had begun.</verse>
  <verse number="13">He catches the wise in their cleverness and dissipates the counsel of the perverse.</verse>
  <verse number="14">They will encounter darkness in the daytime, and they will grope at midday just as in the night.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Thereafter, he will act to save the needy from the sword of their mouth, and the poor from the hand of the violent.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And there will be hope for those in need, for iniquity will diminish its speech.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Blessed is the man whom God corrects; therefore, do not reject the chastisement of the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For he wounds and he cures; he strikes and his hands will heal.</verse>
  <verse number="19">He will deliver you into six tribulations, and in the seventh, evil will not touch you.</verse>
  <verse number="20">During famine, he will rescue you from death, and during war, from the hand of the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="21">You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, and you will not fear calamity when it arrives.</verse>
  <verse number="22">In desolation and in famine, you will laugh, and you will not dread the beasts of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For you are in harmony with the stones of the land, and the beasts of the earth will make peace with you.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And you will know that your home has peace, and, concerning your appearance, you will not sin.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Likewise, you will know that your offspring will be manifold and your progeny will be like the grass of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="26">You will enter the grave with abundance, just as a crop of wheat is gathered in its time.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Behold, this is just as we have found it, which you have heard; walk it through your mind.</verse>
