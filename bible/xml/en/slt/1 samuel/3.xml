  <verse number="1">And the boy Samuel serving Jehovah before Eli, and the word of Jehovah was precious in those days; no vision spread abroad.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And it will be in that day, and Eli lay down in his place, and his eyes began to be weak; he will not be able to see.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And before the lamp of God shall go out, and Samuel lay down in the edifice of Jehovah where there the ark of God.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Jehovah will call to Samuel, and he will say, Behold me.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And he will run to Eli, and say, Behold me, for thou didst call to me. And he will say, I called not; turn back, lie down. And he will go and lie down.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Jehovah will add yet to call Samuel. And Samuel will rise and go to Eli, and say, Behold me, for thou calledst to me. And he will say, I called not my son; turn back, lie down.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And before Samuel will know Jehovah, and before the word of Jehovah will be revealed to him,</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Jehovah will add to call Samuel in the third time. And he will rise and go to Eli, and say, Behold me, for thou didst call to me. And Eli will discern that Jehovah called the boy.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Eli will say to Samuel, Go, lie down; and it being if he shall call to thee, and say thou, Speak, Jehovah, for thy servant heard. And Samuel will go and lie down in his place.</verse>

  <verse number="11">And Jehovah will say to Samuel, Behold, I do a word in Israel which every one hearing it his two ears shall tingle.</verse>
  <verse number="12">In that day I will set up all against Eli which I spake against his house, beginning and finishing.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And I announced to him that I judge his house even forever, for the iniquity which he knew: for his sons cursing for themselves and he admonished them not.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And for this I sware to the house of Eli if the iniquity of the house of Eli shall be covered with sacrifice and with gifts even forever.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Samuel will lie down till the morning, and he will open the doors of the house of Jehovah: and Samuel will be afraid of announcing the vision to Eli.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And Eli will call Samuel, and say, Samuel, my son. And he will say, Behold me.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he will say, What the word he spake to thee? not now shalt thou hide from me: so will God do to thee, and so will he add, if thou shalt hide from me a word of all the word which he spake to thee.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Samuel will announce to him all the words, and he hid not from him. And he will say, It is Jehovah: the good in his eyes he will do.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And Samuel will be magnified, and Jehovah was with him, and there fell not from all his words to the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And all Israel knew from Dan to the Well of the Oath, that Samuel was faithful for a prophet to Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And Jehovah will add to be seen in Shiloh: for Jehovah was revealed to Samuel by the word of Jehovah in Shiloh.</verse>
