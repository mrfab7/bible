<p class="verse" data-verse="1">How will the gold become dim the good gold will be changed the stones of the holy place shall be poured out in the head of all the streets.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The precious sons of Zion being lifted up with fine gold, how they were reckoned for earthen vessels, the work of the hands of the potter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Also the dragons draw out the breast, they suckled their sucklings: the daughter of my people violent as the ostriches in the desert.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The tongue of the suckling adhered to his palate in thirst: the young children asked for bread, none breaking bread to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">They eating for dainties were desolate in the streets: they trusting upon scarlet embraced dung hills.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For the iniquity of the daughter of my people will be great above the sin of Sodom being overthrown as in a moment, and no hands waited for her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Her consecrated ones were pure above snow, they were white above milk, they were red of body above pearls, their figure sapphire:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Their form dark above blackness; they were not known in the streets: their skin adhered to their bones; it was dried up, it was as wood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Those wounded by the sword were good above those wounded by famine: these will flow away, being thrust through from the produce of the field.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The hands of compassionate women boiled their children: they were for food to them in the breaking of the daughter of my people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Jehovah finished his wrath; he poured out the burning of his anger, and he kindled a fire in Zion, and it will devour her foundations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The kings of the earth believed not, and all those dwelling in the habitable globe, that the enemy will come in to the gates of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">From the sins of her prophets the iniquities of her priests shedding the blood of the just in her midst,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The blind were shaken in the streets, they were stained with blood, so that they shall not be able to touch upon their garments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Remove the unclean one, call to them; remove, remove, ye shall not touch: for they were laid waste; they were shaken, say ye, among the nations: they shall not add to sojourn.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The face of Jehovah their portion; he will not add to look upon them: they accepted not the face of the priests, they compassionated not the old men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Continuing, yet our eyes will fail, for our help in vain: in our watching we watched for a nation it will not save us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">They hunted our steps from going in our broad places: our end drew near, our days were completed; for our end came.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">They pursuing us were swift above the eagle of the heavens: they burned after us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the desert.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The spirit of our nostrils, the Messiah of Jehovah was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the nations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, dwelling in the land of Uz; also upon thee shall the cup pass: thou shalt be drunken, and make thyself naked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Thine iniquity was finished, O daughter of Zion; he will not add to carry thee into exile: reviewing thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom, he uncovered upon thy sins.</p>
