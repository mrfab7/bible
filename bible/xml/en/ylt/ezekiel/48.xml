  <verse number="18">And the residue in length over-against the heave-offering of the holy portion is ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward, and it hath been over-against the heave-offering of the holy portion, and its increase hath been for food to the servants of the city,</verse>
  <verse number="19">even to him who is serving the city, they serve it out of all the tribes of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="20">All the heave-offering is five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand, square do ye lift up the heave-offering of the holy portion with the possession of the city.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And the residue is for the prince, on this side and on that side of the heave-offering of the holy portion, and of the possession of the city, on the front of the five and twenty thousand of the heave-offering unto the east border, and westward, on the front of the five and twenty thousand on the west border, over-against the portions of the prince; and the heave-offering of the holy portion, and the sanctuary of the house, hath been in its midst.</verse>
