<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Thou shalt not sacrifice to Jehovah thy God an ox and a sheep which shall be in it a blemish, any evil word, for it is an abomination to Jehovah thy God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">When there shall be found in the midst of thee in one of thy gates which Jehovah thy God gave to thee, a man or a woman who shall do evil in the eyes of Jehovah thy God to pass by his covenant,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And he will go and serve other gods and will worship to them, and to the sun or to the moon, or to any of the army of the heavens, which I commanded not;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And it was announced to thee, and thou heardest and sought out, doing well; and behold, the truth and the word certain this abomination being done in Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And bring thou forth that man or that woman who did this evil word, to thy gates, the man and the woman, and stone them with stones, and they died.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">At the mouth of two witnesses or three witnesses they shall be put to death; they shall not die by the mouth of one witness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The hand of the witnesses shall be at first upon him to put him to death, and the hand of all the people afterward. And put thou away the evil from the midst of thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">When a word shall be hard for thee for judging between blood to blood, between controversy to controversy, and between blow to blow, words of contention in thy gates; and thou didst arise and go up to the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose in it;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And thou didst go to the priests, the Levites, and to the judge which shall be in those days, and seek out; and they shall announce to thee the word of judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And thou shalt do according to the mouth of the word which they shall announce to thee from that place which Jehovah shall choose; and thou shalt watch to do according to all which they shall shew thee:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">According to the mouth of the precept which they shall shew thee, and according to the judgment which they shall say to thee, thou shalt do: thou shalt not turn aside from the word which they shall announce to thee, to the right, and to the left.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And the man which shall do in pride not to hear to the priest, he standing to serve there Jehovah thy God, or to the judge, and that man shall die: and put thou away evil from Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And all the people shall hear, and shall fear, and shall no more act proudly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">When thou shalt come to the land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee, and shall possess it and shall dwell in it, and thou saidst, I will set over me a king according to all the nations which are round about me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Setting, thou shalt set over thee a king whom Jehovah thy God shall choose in him: from the midst of thy brethren thou shalt set over thee a king: thou shalt not be able to set over thee a foreigner who is not of thy brethren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Only he shall not multiply to himself horses, and he shall not turn back the people to Egypt in order to multiply the horse: and Jehovah said to you, Ye shall no more add to turn back that way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And he shall not multiply to him wives, and his heart shall not turn away: and silver and gold he shall not greatly multiply to himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And it was when he sits upon the throne of his kingdom and he wrote for him this second law upon a book, from before the priests, the Levites.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And it shall be with him, and he read in it all the days of his life; so that he shall learn to fear Jehovah his God, to watch all the words of this instruction and these laws to do them:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Not to lift up his head above his brethren, and not to turn away from the commands, to the right or to the left; so that he shall prolong the days upon his kingdom he, and his sons in the midst of Israel.</p>
