<p class="verse" data-verse="1">When I would heal Israel, Then is the iniquity of Ephraim uncovered, And the wickedness of Samaria, For they commit falsehood; And the thief entereth in, And the troop of robbers maketh a raid without.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And let them not say to their heartâ€”I remember all their wickedness; Now their own doings have beset them about, They are before My face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">They make the king glad with their wickedness, And the princes with their lies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">They are all adulterers, As an oven heated by the baker, Who ceaseth to stir From the kneading of the dough until it be leavened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">On the day of our king The princes make him sick with the heat of wine, He stretcheth out his hand with scorners.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For they have made ready their heart like an oven, while they lie in wait; Their baker sleepeth all the night, In the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">They are all hot as an oven, And devour their judges; All their kings are fallen, There is none among them that calleth unto Me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Ephraim, he mixeth himself with the peoples; Ephraim is become a cake not turned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Strangers have devoured his strength, And he knoweth it not; Yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, And he knoweth it not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face; But they have not returned unto the LORD their God, Nor sought Him, for all this.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And Ephraim is become like a silly dove, without understanding; They call unto Egypt, they go to Assyria.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Even as they go, I will spread My net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath been made to hear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Woe unto them! for they have strayed from Me; Destruction unto them! for they have transgressed against Me; Shall I then redeem them, Seeing they have spoken lies against Me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And they have not cried unto Me with their heart, Though they wail upon their beds; They assemble themselves for corn and wine, they rebel against Me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Though I have trained and strengthened their arms, Yet do they devise evil against Me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">They return, but not upwards; They are become like a deceitful bow; Their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue; This shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.</p>
