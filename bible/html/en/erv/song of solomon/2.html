<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I AM a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">As a lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Stay ye me with raisins, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awaken love, until it please.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh, leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh in at the windows, he sheweth himself through the lattice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The fig tree ripeneth her green figs, and the vines are in blossom, they give forth their fragrance. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the covert of the steep place, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice: for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vineyards; for our vineyards are in blossom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth his flock among the lilies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Until the day be cool, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.</p>
