  <verse number="1">And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, show yourself to Ahab; and I will send rain on the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. And there was a sore famine in Samaria.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:</verse>
  <verse number="4">For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Ahab said to Obadiah, Go into the land, to all fountains of water, and to all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.</verse>
  <verse number="6">So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Are you that my lord Elijah?</verse>
  <verse number="8">And he answered him, I am: go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah is here.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And he said, What have I sinned, that you would deliver your servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?</verse>
  <verse number="10">As the LORD your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom, where my lord has not sent to seek you: and when they said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found you not.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And now you say, Go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah is here.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from you, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry you where I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find you, he shall slay me: but I your servant fear the LORD from my youth.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD’s prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?</verse>
  <verse number="14">And now you say, Go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and he shall slay me.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him to day.</verse>
  <verse number="16">So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said to him, Are you he that troubles Israel?</verse>
  <verse number="18">And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but you, and your father’s house, in that you have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and you have followed Baalim.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel to mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel’s table.</verse>
  <verse number="20">So Ahab sent to all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together to mount Carmel.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And Elijah came to all the people, and said, How long halt you between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Then said Elijah to the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baal’s prophets are four hundred and fifty men.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:</verse>
  <verse number="24">And call you on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answers by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for you are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped on the altar which was made.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleeps, and must be awaked.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out on them.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And Elijah said to all the people, Come near to me. And all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be your name:</verse>
  <verse number="32">And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word.</verse>
  <verse number="37">Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that you are the LORD God, and that you have turned their heart back again.</verse>
  <verse number="38">Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And Elijah said to them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And Elijah said to Ahab, Get you up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.</verse>
  <verse number="42">So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down on the earth, and put his face between his knees,</verse>
  <verse number="43">And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.</verse>
  <verse number="44">And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there rises a little cloud out of the sea, like a man’s hand. And he said, Go up, say to Ahab, Prepare your chariot, and get you down that the rain stop you not.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.</verse>
  <verse number="46">And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.</verse>
