  <verse number="1">My spirit is consumed, my days are extinct, The grave is ready for me.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Surely there are mockers with me, And mine eye abideth in their provocation.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Give now a pledge, be surety for me with Thyself; Who else is there that will strike hands with me?</verse>
  <verse number="4">For Thou hast hid their heart from understanding; Therefore shalt Thou not exalt them.</verse>
  <verse number="5">He that denounceth his friends for the sake of flattery, Even the eyes of his children shall fail.</verse>
  <verse number="6">He hath made me also a byword of the people; And I am become one in whose face they spit.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Mine eye also is dimmed by reason of vexation, And all my members are as a shadow.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Upright men are astonished at this, And the innocent stirreth up himself against the godless.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Yet the righteous holdeth on his way, And he that hath clean hands waxeth stronger and stronger.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But as for you all, do ye return, and come now; And I shall not find a wise man among you.</verse>
  <verse number="11">My days are past, my purposes are broken off, Even the thoughts of my heart.</verse>
  <verse number="12">They change the night into day; The light is short because of darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="13">If I look for the nether-world as my house; If I have spread my couch in the darkness;</verse>
  <verse number="14">If I have said to corruption: ‘Thou art my father’, To the worm: ‘Thou art my mother, and my sister’;</verse>
  <verse number="15">Where then is my hope? And as for my hope, who shall see it?</verse>
  <verse number="16">They shall go down to the bars of the nether-world, When we are at rest together in the dust.</verse>
