<chapter book="Isaiah" number="3" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">For behold, the Lord GOD of Hosts is about to remove from Jerusalem and Judah both supply and support: the whole supply of food and water,</verse>
  <verse number="2">the mighty man and the warrior, the judge and the prophet, the soothsayer and the elder,</verse>
  <verse number="3">the commander of fifty and the dignitary, the counselor, the cunning magician, and the clever enchanter.</verse>
  <verse number="4">“I will make mere lads their leaders, and children will rule over them.”</verse>
  <verse number="5">The people will oppress one another, man against man, neighbor against neighbor; the young will rise up against the old, and the base against the honorable.</verse>
  <verse number="6">A man will seize his brother within his father’s house: “You have a cloak—you be our leader! Take charge of this heap of rubble.”</verse>
  <verse number="7">On that day he will cry aloud: “I am not a healer. I have no food or clothing in my house. Do not make me leader of the people!”</verse>
  <verse number="8">For Jerusalem has stumbled and Judah has fallen because they spoke and acted against the LORD, defying His glorious presence.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The expression on their faces testifies against them, and like Sodom they flaunt their sin; they do not conceal it. Woe to them, for they have brought disaster upon themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Tell the righteous it will be well with them, for they will enjoy the fruit of their labor.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Woe to the wicked; disaster is upon them! For they will be repaid with what their hands have done.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Youths oppress My people, and women rule over them. O My people, your guides mislead you; they turn you from your paths.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The LORD arises to contend; He stands to judge the people.</verse>
  <verse number="14">The LORD brings this charge against the elders and leaders of His people: “You have devoured the vineyard; the plunder of the poor is in your houses.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Why do you crush My people and grind the faces of the poor?” declares the Lord GOD of Hosts.</verse>
  <verse number="16">The LORD also says: “Because the daughters of Zion are haughty—walking with heads held high and wanton eyes, prancing and skipping as they go, jingling the bracelets on their ankles—</verse>
  <verse number="17">the Lord will bring sores on the heads of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will make their foreheads bare.”</verse>
  <verse number="18">In that day the Lord will take away their finery: their anklets and headbands and crescents;</verse>
  <verse number="19">their pendants, bracelets, and veils;</verse>
  <verse number="20">their headdresses, ankle chains, and sashes; their perfume bottles and charms;</verse>
  <verse number="21">their signet rings and nose rings;</verse>
  <verse number="22">their festive robes, capes, cloaks, and purses;</verse>
  <verse number="23">and their mirrors, linen garments, tiaras, and shawls.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Instead of fragrance there will be a stench; instead of a belt, a rope; instead of styled hair, baldness; instead of fine clothing, sackcloth; instead of beauty, shame.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Your men will fall by the sword, and your warriors in battle.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And the gates of Zion will lament and mourn; destitute, she will sit on the ground.</verse>
