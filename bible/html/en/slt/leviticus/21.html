<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Jehovah will say to Moses, Say to the priests the sons of Aaron, and say to them, for the soul he shall not be defiled among his peoples.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">But if for his remainder coming near to him, for his mother and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And for his sister, a virgin, coming near to him, who was not for a husband for her, he shall be defiled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">A chief among his people shall not be defiled, to profane himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">With baldness, they shall not make baldness upon their head, and they shall not shave the extremity of their beard: and in their flesh they shall not cut incisions.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">They shall be holy to their God, and profane not the name of their God: for the sacrifices of Jehovah, and the bread of their God they bring: and they were holy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">They shall not take a woman, a harlot, or profane; and they shall not take a wife driven away from her husband, for he is holy to his God.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Speak to Aaron saying, A man from thy seed according to their generations, to whom shall be in him a blemish, shall not come near to bring the bread of his God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For every man to whom in him a blemish shall not come near: a man blind, or lame, or flat-nosed, or stretched out,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Or a man to whom there shall be in him a broken foot or a broken hand,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Or curved, or withered, or stained in his eye, or scurvy, or scabby, or a bruised testicle:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Any man to whom in him a blemish from the seed of Aaron the priest, shall not come near to bring the sacrifices of Jehovah: a blemish is in him, the bread of his God he shall not come near to bring.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The bread of his God the holy of holies, and from the holies shall he eat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">But he shall not come in to the vail, and to the altar he shall not come near, for a blemish is in him; and he shall not profane my holy place: for I Jehovah consecrating them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And Moses will speak to Aaron and to his sons and to all the sons of Israel.</p>
