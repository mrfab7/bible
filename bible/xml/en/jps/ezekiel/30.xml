  <verse number="1">And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Son of man, prophesy, and say: Thus saith the Lord GOD: Wail ye: Woe worth the day!</verse>
  <verse number="3">For the day is near, Even the day of the LORD is near, A day of clouds, it shall be the time of the nations.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And a sword shall come upon Egypt, And convulsion shall be in Ethiopia, When the slain shall fall in Egypt; And they shall take away her abundance, And her foundation shall be broken down.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Ethiopia, and Put, and Lud, and all the mingled people, and Cub, and the children of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Thus saith the LORD: They also that uphold Egypt shall fall, And the pride of her power shall come down; From Migdol to Syene shall they fall in it by the sword, Saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, And her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And they shall know that I am the LORD, When I have set a fire in Egypt, And all her helpers are destroyed.</verse>
  <verse number="9">In that day shall messengers go forth from before Me in ships To make the confident Ethiopians afraid; And there shall come convulsion upon them in the day of Egypt; For, lo, it cometh.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Thus saith the Lord GOD: I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease, By the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, Shall be brought in to destroy the land; And they shall draw their swords against Egypt, And fill the land with the slain.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And I will make the rivers dry, And will give the land over into the hand of evil men; And I will make the land desolate, And all that is therein, by the hand of strangers; I the LORD have spoken it.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Thus saith the Lord GOD: I will also destroy the idols, And I will cause the things of nought to cease from Noph; And there shall be no more a prince out of the land of Egypt; And I will put a fear in the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And I will make Pathros desolate, And will set a fire in Zoan, And will execute judgments in No.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And I will pour My fury upon Sin, the stronghold of Egypt; And I will cut off the multitude of No.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And I will set a fire in Egypt; Sin shall be in great convulsion, And No shall be rent asunder; And in Noph shall come adversaries in the day-time.</verse>
  <verse number="17">The young men of Aven and of Pi-beseth shall fall by the sword; And these cities shall go into captivity.</verse>
  <verse number="18">At Tehaphnehes also the day shall withdraw itself, When I shall break there the yokes of Egypt, And the pride of her power shall cease in her; As for her, a cloud shall cover her, And her daughters shall go into captivity.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Thus will I execute judgments in Egypt; And they shall know that I am the LORD.’</verse>
  <verse number="20">And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, in the seventh day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="21">Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, lo, it hath not been bound up to be healed, to put a roller, that it be bound up and wax strong, that it hold the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong, and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put My sword in his hand; but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And I will hold up the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall put My sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them through the countries; and they shall know that I am the LORD.’</verse>
