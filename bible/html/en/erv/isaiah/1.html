<div class="chapter" data-book="Isaiah" data-chapter="1" data-translation="English Revised Version" data-translation-id="erv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the LORD hath spoken: I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evil-doers, children that deal corruptly: they have forsaken the LORD, they have despised the Holy One of Israel, they are estranged and gone backward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Why will ye be still stricken, that ye revolt more and more? the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and festering sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with oil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Your country is desolate; your cities are burned with fire; your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to trample my courts?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; new moon and sabbath, the calling of assemblies,—I cannot away with iniquity and the solemn meeting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">but if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">How is the faithful city become an harlot! she that was full of judgment! righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves; every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">and I will turn my hand upon thee, and throughly purge away thy dross, and will take away all thy tin:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">and I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called The city of righteousness, the faithful city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">But the destruction of the transgressors and the sinners shall be together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And the strong shall be as tow, and his work as a spark; and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.</p>
