<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="42" data-translation="World English Bible" data-translation-id="web" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered Yahweh,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“I know that you can do all things, and that no purpose of yours can be restrained.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">You asked, ‘Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge?’ therefore I have uttered that which I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I didn’t know.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">You said, ‘Listen, now, and I will speak; I will question you, and you will answer me.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Therefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">It was so, that after Yahweh had spoken these words to Job, Yahweh said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “My wrath is kindled against you, and against your two friends; for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Now therefore, take to yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept him, that I not deal with you according to your folly. For you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did what Yahweh commanded them, and Yahweh accepted Job.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Yahweh turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends. Yahweh gave Job twice as much as he had before.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Then came there to him all his brothers, and all his sisters, and all those who had been of his acquaintance before, and ate bread with him in his house. They comforted him, and consoled him concerning all the evil that Yahweh had brought on him. Everyone also gave him a piece of money, and everyone a ring of gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">So Yahweh blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand female donkeys.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He had also seven sons and three daughters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">He called the name of the first, Jemimah; and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren Happuch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">In all the land were no women found so beautiful as the daughters of Job. Their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">After this Job lived one hundred forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, to four generations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">So Job died, being old and full of days.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="1199">Psalm 78:8	and might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that didn’t make their hearts loyal, whose spirit was not steadfast with God.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="1208">Psalm 78:17	Yet they still went on to sin against him, to rebel against the Most High in the desert.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1209">Psalm 78:18	They tempted God in their heart by asking food according to their desire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1210">Psalm 78:19	Yes, they spoke against God. They said, “Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1211">Psalm 78:20	Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out, and streams overflowed. Can he give bread also? Will he provide flesh for his people?”</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="1219">Psalm 78:28	He let them fall in the midst of their camp, around their habitations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1220">Psalm 78:29	So they ate, and were well filled. He gave them their own desire.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="1226">Psalm 78:35	They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God, their redeemer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1227">Psalm 78:36	But they flattered him with their mouth, and lied to him with their tongue.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="1229">Psalm 78:38	But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn’t destroy them. Yes, many times he turned his anger away, and didn’t stir up all his wrath.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="1234">Psalm 78:43	how he set his signs in Egypt, his wonders in the field of Zoan,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1235">Psalm 78:44	he turned their rivers into blood, and their streams, so that they could not drink.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1236">Psalm 78:45	He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1237">Psalm 78:46	He gave also their increase to the caterpillar, and their labor to the locust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1238">Psalm 78:47	He destroyed their vines with hail, their sycamore fig trees with frost.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1239">Psalm 78:48	He gave over their livestock also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1240">Psalm 78:49	He threw on them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, indignation, and trouble, and a band of angels of evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1241">Psalm 78:50	He made a path for his anger. He didn’t spare their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1242">Psalm 78:51	and struck all the firstborn in Egypt, the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1243">Psalm 78:52	But he led forth his own people like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1244">Psalm 78:53	He led them safely, so that they weren’t afraid, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1245">Psalm 78:54	He brought them to the border of his sanctuary, to this mountain, which his right hand had taken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1246">Psalm 78:55	He also drove out the nations before them, allotted them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1247">Psalm 78:56	Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, and didn’t keep his testimonies;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1248">Psalm 78:57	but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers. They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1249">Psalm 78:58	For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1250">Psalm 78:59	When God heard this, he was angry, and greatly abhorred Israel;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1251">Psalm 78:60	So that he forsook the tent of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1252">Psalm 78:61	and delivered his strength into captivity, his glory into the adversary’s hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1253">Psalm 78:62	He also gave his people over to the sword, and was angry with his inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1254">Psalm 78:63	Fire devoured their young men. Their virgins had no wedding song.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1255">Psalm 78:64	Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows couldn’t weep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1256">Psalm 78:65	Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep, like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1257">Psalm 78:66	He struck his adversaries backward. He put them to a perpetual reproach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1258">Psalm 78:67	Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph, and didn’t choose the tribe of Ephraim,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1259">Psalm 78:68	But chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion which he loved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1260">Psalm 78:69	He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he has established forever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1261">Psalm 78:70	He also chose David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1262">Psalm 78:71	from following the ewes that have their young, he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people, and Israel, his inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1263">Psalm 78:72	So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="1268">Psalm 79:5	How long, Yahweh? Will you be angry forever? Will your jealousy burn like fire?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1269">Psalm 79:6	Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t know you; on the kingdoms that don’t call on your name;</p>
