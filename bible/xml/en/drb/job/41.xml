  <verse number="1">Canst thou draw out the leviathan with a hook, or canst thou tie his tongue with a cord?</verse>
  <verse number="2">Canst thou put a ring in his nose, or bore through his jaw with a buckle?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Will he make many supplications to thee, or speak soft words to thee?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Will he make a covenant with thee, and wilt thou take him to be a servant for ever?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Shalt thou play with him as with a bird, or tie him up for thy handmaids?</verse>
  <verse number="6">Shall friends cut him in pieces, shall merchants divide him?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Wilt thou fill nets with his skin, and the cabins of fishes with his head?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Lay thy hand upon him : remember the battle, and speak no more.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Behold his hope shall fail him, and in the sight of all he shall be cast down.</verse>
  <verse number="10">I will not stir him up, like one that is cruel : for who can resist my countenance?</verse>
  <verse number="11">Who hath given me before that I should repay him? All things that are under heaven are mine.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I will not spare him, nor his mighty words, and framed to make supplication.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can go into the midst of his mouth?</verse>
  <verse number="14">Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.</verse>
  <verse number="15">His body is like molten shields, shut close up with scales pressing upon one another.</verse>
  <verse number="16">One is joined to another, and not so much as any air can come between them :</verse>
  <verse number="17">They stick one to another and they hold one another fast, and shall not be separated.</verse>
  <verse number="18">His sneezing is like the shining of fire, and his eyes like the eyelids of the morning.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Out of his mouth go forth lamps, like torches of lighted fire.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, like that of a pot heated and boiling.</verse>
  <verse number="21">His breath kindleth coals, and a flame cometh forth out of his mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="22">In his neck strength shall dwell, and want goeth before his face.</verse>
  <verse number="23">The members of his flesh cleave one to another : he shall send lightnings against him, and they shall not be carried to another place.</verse>
  <verse number="24">His heart shall be as hard as a stone, and as firm as a smith’s anvil.</verse>
  <verse number="25">When he shall raise him up, the angels shall fear, and being affrighted shall purify themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="26">When a sword shall lay at him, it shall not be able to hold, nor a spear, nor a breastplate.</verse>
  <verse number="27">For he shall esteem iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.</verse>
  <verse number="28">The archer shall not put him to flight, the stones of the sling are to him like stubble.</verse>
  <verse number="29">As stubble will he esteem the hammer, and he will laugh him to scorn who shaketh the spear.</verse>
  <verse number="30">The beams of the sun shall be under him, and he shall strew gold under him like mire.</verse>
  <verse number="31">He shall make the deep sea to boil like a pot, and shall make it as when ointments boil.</verse>
  <verse number="32">A path shall shine after him, he shall esteem the deep as growing old.</verse>
  <verse number="33">There is no power upon earth that can be compared with him who was made to fear no one.</verse>
  <verse number="34">He beholdeth every high thing, he is king over all the children of pride.</verse>
