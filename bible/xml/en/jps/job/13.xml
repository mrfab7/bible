  <verse number="1">Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, Mine ear hath heard and understood it.</verse>
  <verse number="2">What ye know, do I know also; I am not inferior unto you.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Notwithstanding I would speak to the Almighty, And I desire to reason with God.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But ye are plasterers of lies, Ye are all physicians of no value.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Oh that ye would altogether hold your peace! And it would be your wisdom.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Hear now my reasoning, And hearken to the pleadings of my lips.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Will ye speak unrighteously for God, And talk deceitfully for Him?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Will ye show Him favour? Will ye contend for God?</verse>
  <verse number="9">Would it be good that He should search you out? Or as one mocketh a man, will ye mock Him?</verse>
  <verse number="10">He will surely reprove you, If ye do secretly show favour.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Shall not His majesty terrify you, And His dread fall upon you?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Your memorials shall be like unto ashes, Your eminences to eminences of clay.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, And let come on me what will.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Wherefore? I will take my flesh in my teeth, And put my life in my hand.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him; But I will argue my ways before Him.</verse>
  <verse number="16">This also shall be my salvation, That a hypocrite cannot come before Him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Hear diligently my speech, And let my declaration be in your ears.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be justified.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Who is he that will contend with me? For then would I hold my peace and die.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Only do not two things unto me, Then will I not hide myself from Thee:</verse>
  <verse number="21">Withdraw Thy hand far from me; And let not Thy terror make me afraid.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Then call Thou, and I will answer; Or let me speak, and answer Thou me.</verse>
  <verse number="23">How many are mine iniquities and sins? Make me to know my transgression and my sin.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Wherefore hidest Thou Thy face, And holdest me for Thine enemy?</verse>
  <verse number="25">Wilt Thou harass a driven leaf? And wilt Thou pursue the dry stubble?</verse>
  <verse number="26">That Thou shouldest write bitter things against me, And make me to inherit the iniquities of my youth.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, And lookest narrowly unto all my paths; Thou drawest Thee a line about the soles of my feet;</verse>
  <verse number="28">Though I am like a wine-skin that consumeth, Like a garment that is moth-eaten.</verse>
