  <verse number="1">“Hear this, O priests! Take heed, O house of Israel! Give ear, O royal house! For this judgment is against you because you have been a snare at Mizpah, a net spread out on Tabor.</verse>
  <verse number="2">The rebels are deep in slaughter; but I will chastise them all.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I know all about Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from Me. For now, O Ephraim, you have turned to prostitution; Israel is defiled.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Their deeds do not permit them to return to their God, for a spirit of prostitution is within them, and they do not know the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Israel’s arrogance testifies against them; Israel and Ephraim stumble in their iniquity; even Judah stumbles with them.</verse>
  <verse number="6">They go with their flocks and herds to seek the LORD, but they do not find Him; He has withdrawn Himself from them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">They have been unfaithful to the LORD; for they have borne illegitimate children. Now the New Moon will devour them along with their land.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Blow the ram’s horn in Gibeah, the trumpet in Ramah; raise the battle cry in Beth-aven: Lead on, O Benjamin!</verse>
  <verse number="9">Ephraim will be laid waste on the day of rebuke. Among the tribes of Israel I proclaim what is certain.</verse>
  <verse number="10">The princes of Judah are like those who move boundary stones; I will pour out My fury upon them like water.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Ephraim is oppressed, crushed in judgment, for he is determined to follow worthless idols.</verse>
  <verse number="12">So I am like a moth to Ephraim, and like decay to the house of Judah.</verse>
  <verse number="13">When Ephraim saw his sickness and Judah his wound, then Ephraim turned to Assyria and sent to the great king. But he cannot cure you or heal your wound.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For I am like a lion to Ephraim and like a young lion to the house of Judah. I, even I, will tear them to pieces and then go away. I will carry them off where no one can rescue them.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Then I will return to My place until they admit their guilt and seek My face; in their affliction they will earnestly seek Me.”</verse>
