<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him to Pilate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Pilate asked him, saying, Are you the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, You say it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And as soon as he knew that he belonged to Herodâ€™s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And Herod with his men of war set him at nothing, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Said to them, You have brought this man to me, as one that perverts the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof you accuse him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, see, nothing worthy of death is done to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">(For of necessity he must release one to them at the feast.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spoke again to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And he said to them the third time, Why, what evil has he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And he released to them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And as they led him away, they laid hold on one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">But Jesus turning to them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts which never gave suck.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And saying, If you be the king of the Jews, save yourself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If you be Christ, save yourself and us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Do not you fear God, seeing you are in the same condemnation?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man has done nothing amiss.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">And he said to Jesus, Lord, remember me when you come into your kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, To day shall you be with me in paradise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the middle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into your hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counselor; and he was a good man, and a just:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="52">This man went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulcher that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="54">And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="55">And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulcher, and how his body was laid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="56">And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.</p>
