1	Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said:
2	How long will ye lay snares for words? Consider, and afterwards we will speak.
3	Wherefore are we counted as beasts, And reputed dull in your sight?
4	Thou that tearest thyself in thine anger, Shall the earth be forsaken for thee? Or shall the rock be removed out of its place?
5	Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, And the spark of his fire shall not shine.
6	The light shall be dark in his tent, And his lamp over him shall be put out.
7	The steps of his strength shall be straitened, And his own counsel shall cast him down.
8	For he is cast into a net by his own feet, And he walketh upon the toils.
9	A gin shall take him by the heel, And a snare shall lay hold on him.
10	A noose is hid for him in the ground, And a trap for him in the way.
11	Terrors shall overwhelm him on every side, And shall entrap him at his feet.
12	His trouble shall be ravenous, And calamity shall be ready for his fall.
13	It shall devour the members of his body, Yea, the first-born of death shall devour his members.
14	That wherein he trusteth shall be plucked out of his tent; And he shall be brought to the king of terrors.
15	There shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his; Brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.
16	His roots shall dry up beneath, And above shall his branch wither.
17	His remembrance shall perish from the earth, And he shall have no name abroad.
18	He shall be driven from light into darkness, And chased out of the world.
19	He shall have neither son nor sonâ€™s son among his people, Nor any remaining in his dwellings.
20	They that come after shall be astonished at his day, As they that went before are affrighted.
21	Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, And this is the place of him that knoweth not God.
