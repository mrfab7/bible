<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Bear ye one anotherâ€™s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For every man shall bear his own burden.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all [men], especially unto them who are of the household of faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And as many as walk according to this rule, peace [be] on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit. Amen.</p>
