<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Corinthians" data-chapter="5" data-translation="World English Bible" data-translation-id="web" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles, that one has his father’s wife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">You are puffed up, and didn’t rather mourn, that he who had done this deed might be removed from among you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For I most certainly, as being absent in body but present in spirit, have already, as though I were present, judged him who has done this thing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">are to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Your boasting is not good. Don’t you know that a little yeast leavens the whole lump?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Purge out the old yeast, that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed in our place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old yeast, neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">I wrote to you in my letter to have no company with sexual sinners;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then you would have to leave the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">But as it is, I wrote to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother who is a sexual sinner, or covetous, or an idolater, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner. Don’t even eat with such a person.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For what have I to do with also judging those who are outside? Don’t you judge those who are within?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But those who are outside, God judges. “Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.”</p>
