1	Ephraim fed upon the wind, and he pursued the east wind: all the day he multiplied falsehood and destruction; and they will cut out a covenant with Assur, and oil will be brought to Egypt.
2	And a contention to Jehovah with Judah, and to review Jacob according to his ways; he will turn back to him according to his doings.
3	In the belly he circumvented his brother, and by his strength he was a leader with God.
4	And he will be a leader to the messenger, and he will prevail: he wept, and he will make supplication to him: in the house of God he will find him, and there he will speak with him.
5	And Jehovah God of armies, Jehovah his remembrance.
6	And thou, in thy God thou shalt turn back: watch mercy and judgment, and wait always for thy God.
7	Canaan in his hand, the balances of deceit: he loved to oppress.
8	And Ephraim will say, Surely I became rich, I found to me wealth: all my labors shall not be found to me iniquity which was sin.
9	And I am Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt; I will even cause thee to dwell in tents as in the days of the appointment.
10	And I spake by the prophets, and I multiplied the vision, and by the hand of the prophets I will use similitudes.
11	If Gilead nothing? Surely they were vanity: in Gilgal they sacrificed oxen; also their altars as heaps upon the furrows of the field.
12	And Jacob will flee to the field of Aram, and Israel will serve for a wife, and for a wife he watched.
13	And by a prophet Jehovah brought up Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet he was preserved.
14	Ephraim provoked bitternesses, and bloods shall fly swiftly upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord turn back to him.
