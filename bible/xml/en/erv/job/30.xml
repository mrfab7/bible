<chapter book="Job" number="30" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I disdained to set with the dogs of my flock.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Yea, the strength of their hands, whereto should it profit me? men in whom ripe age is perished.</verse>
  <verse number="3">They are gaunt with want and famine; they gnaw the dry ground; in the gloom of wasteness and desolation.</verse>
  <verse number="4">They pluck salt-wort by the bushes; and the roots of the broom are their meat.</verse>
  <verse number="5">They are driven forth from the midst of men; they cry after them as after a thief.</verse>
  <verse number="6">In the clefts of the valleys must they dwell, in holes of the earth and of the rocks.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Among the bushes they bray; under the nettles they are gathered together.</verse>
  <verse number="8">They are children of fools, yea, children of base men; they were scourged out of the land.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And now I am become their song, yea, I am a byword unto them.</verse>
  <verse number="10">They abhor me, they stand aloof from me, and spare not to spit in my face.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For he hath loosed his cord, and afflicted me, and they have cast off the bridle before me.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Upon my right hand rise the rabble; they thrust aside my feet, and they cast up against me their ways of destruction.</verse>
  <verse number="13">They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, even men that have no helper.</verse>
  <verse number="14">As through a wide breach they come: in the midst of the ruin they roll themselves upon me.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Terrors are turned upon me, they chase mine honour as the wind; and my welfare is passed away as a cloud.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And now my soul is poured out within me; days of affliction have taken hold upon me.</verse>
  <verse number="17">In the night season my bones are pierced in me, and the pains that gnaw me take no rest.</verse>
  <verse number="18">By the great force of my disease is my garment disfigured: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.</verse>
  <verse number="19">He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.</verse>
  <verse number="20">I cry unto thee, and thou dost not answer me: I stand up, and thou lookest at me.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Thou art turned to be cruel to me: with the might of thy hand thou persecutest me.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Thou liftest me up to the wind, thou causest me to ride upon it; and thou dissolvest me in the storm.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Surely against a ruinous heap he will not put forth his hand; though it be in his destruction, one may utter a cry because of these things.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the needy?</verse>
  <verse number="26">When I looked for good, then evil came; and when I waited for light, there came darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="27">My bowels boil, and rest not; days of affliction are come upon me.</verse>
  <verse number="28">I go mourning without the sun: I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help.</verse>
  <verse number="29">I am a brother to jackals, and a companion to ostriches.</verse>
  <verse number="30">My skin is black, and falleth from me, and my bones are burned with heat.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Therefore is my harp turned to mourning, and my pipe into the voice of them that weep.</verse>
