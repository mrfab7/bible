<chapter book="Job" number="34" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And Elihu answereth and saith:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Hear, O wise men, my words, And, O knowing ones, give ear to me.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For the ear doth try words, And the palate tasteth to eat.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Judgment let us choose for ourselves, Let us know among ourselves what is good.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For Job hath said, ‘I have been righteous, And God hath turned aside my right,</verse>
  <verse number="6">Against my right do I lie? Mortal is mine arrow—without transgression.’</verse>
  <verse number="7">Who is a man like Job? He drinketh scoffing like water,</verse>
  <verse number="8">And he hath travelled for company With workers of iniquity, So as to go with men of wickedness.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For he hath said, ‘It doth not profit a man, When he delighteth himself with God.’</verse>
  <verse number="10">Therefore, O men of heart, hearken to me; Far be it from God to do wickedness, And from the Mighty to do perverseness:</verse>
  <verse number="11">For the work of man he repayeth to him, And according to the path of each He doth cause him to find.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Yea, truly, God doth not do wickedly, And the Mighty doth not pervert judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Who hath inspected for Himself the earth? And who hath placed all the habitable world?</verse>
  <verse number="14">If He doth set on him His heart, His spirit and his breath unto Him He gathereth.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Expire doth all flesh together, And man to dust returneth.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And if there is understanding, hear this, Give ear to the voice of my words.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Yea, doth one hating justice govern? Or the Most Just dost thou condemn?</verse>
  <verse number="18">Who hath said to a king—‘Worthless,’ Unto princes—‘Wicked?’</verse>
  <verse number="19">That hath not accepted the person of princes, Nor hath known the rich before the poor, For a work of His hands are all of them.</verse>
  <verse number="20">In a moment they die, and at midnight Shake do people, and they pass away, And they remove the mighty without hand.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For His eyes are on the ways of each, And all his steps He doth see.</verse>
  <verse number="22">There is no darkness nor death-shade, For workers of iniquity to be hidden there;</verse>
  <verse number="23">For He doth not suffer man any more, To go unto God in judgment,</verse>
  <verse number="24">He breaketh the mighty—no searching! And He appointeth others in their stead.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Therefore He knoweth their works, And He hath overturned by night, And they are bruised.</verse>
  <verse number="26">As wicked He hath stricken them, In the place of beholders.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Because that against right They have turned aside from after Him, And none of His ways have considered wisely,</verse>
  <verse number="28">To cause to come in unto Him The cry of the poor, And the cry of the afflicted He heareth.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And He giveth rest, and who maketh wrong? And hideth the face, and who beholdeth it? And in reference to a nation and to a man, It is the same.</verse>
  <verse number="30">From the reigning of a profane man, From the snares of a people;</verse>
  <verse number="31">For unto God hath any said: ‘I have taken away, I do not corruptly,</verse>
  <verse number="32">Besides that which I see, shew Thou me, If iniquity I have done—I do not add?’</verse>
  <verse number="33">By thee doth He recompense, That thou hast refused—That thou dost choose, and not I? And what thou hast known, speak.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Let men of heart say to me, And a wise man is hearkening to me.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Job—not with knowledge doth he speak, And his words are not with wisdom.</verse>
  <verse number="36">My Father! let Job be tried—unto victory, Because of answers for men of iniquity,</verse>
  <verse number="37">For he doth add to his sin, Transgression among us he vomiteth, And multiplieth his sayings to God.</verse>
