  <verse number="1">There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:</verse>
  <verse number="2">The same came to Jesus by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Jesus answered and said to him, Verily, verily, I say to thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Nicodemus saith to him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say to thee, Except a man be born of water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</verse>
  <verse number="6">That which is born of the flesh, is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit, is spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Marvel not that I said to thee, Ye must be born again.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The wind bloweth where it will, and thou hearest the sound of it, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Nicodemus answered and said to him, How can these things be?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Jesus answered and said to him, Art thou a teacher of Israel, and knowest not these things?</verse>
  <verse number="11">Verily, verily, I say to thee, We speak what we know, and testify what we have seen; and ye receive not our testimony.</verse>
  <verse number="12">If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how will ye believe if I tell you heavenly things?</verse>
  <verse number="13">And no man hath ascended to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man who is in heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:</verse>
  <verse number="15">That whoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whoever believeth in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him may be saved.</verse>
  <verse number="18">He that believeth on him, is not condemned: but he that believeth not, is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men have loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But he that doeth truth, cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</verse>
  <verse number="22">After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And John also was baptizing in Enon, near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.</verse>
  <verse number="24">For John was not yet cast into prison.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Then there arose a question between some of John’s disciples and the Jews, about purifying.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou didst bear testimony, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.</verse>
  <verse number="27">John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Ye yourselves bear me testimony, that I said I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.</verse>
  <verse number="29">He that hath the bride, is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly, because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.</verse>
  <verse number="30">He must increase, but I must decrease.</verse>
  <verse number="31">He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.</verse>
  <verse number="33">He that hath received his testimony, hath set to his seal that God is true.</verse>
  <verse number="34">For he whom God hath sent, speaketh the words of God: for to him God giveth not the Spirit by measure.</verse>
  <verse number="35">The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.</verse>
  <verse number="36">He that believeth on the Son, hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son, shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</verse>
