<chapter book="Mark" number="8" translation="King James Bible" translationID="kjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples [unto him], and saith unto them,</verse>
  <verse number="2">I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:</verse>
  <verse number="3">And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these [men] with bread here in the wilderness?</verse>
  <verse number="5">And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before [them]; and they did set [them] before the people.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before [them].</verse>
  <verse number="8">So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken [meat] that was left seven baskets.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Now [the disciples] had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and [of] the leaven of Herod.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And they reasoned among themselves, saying, [It is] because we have no bread.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And when Jesus knew [it], he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?</verse>
  <verse number="18">Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?</verse>
  <verse number="19">When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?</verse>
  <verse number="22">And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.</verse>
  <verse number="25">After that he put [his] hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell [it] to any in the town.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?</verse>
  <verse number="28">And they answered, John the Baptist: but some [say], Elias; and others, One of the prophets.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and [of] the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.</verse>
  <verse number="33">But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And when he had called the people [unto him] with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</verse>
  <verse number="35">For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s, the same shall save it.</verse>
  <verse number="36">For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?</verse>
  <verse number="37">Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</verse>
  <verse number="38">Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.</verse>
