<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="34" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Furthermore Elihu answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hear my words, O you wise men; and give ear to me, you that have knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For the ear tries words, as the mouth tastes meat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For Job has said, I am righteous: and God has taken away my judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">What man is like Job, who drinks up scorning like water?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Which goes in company with the workers of iniquity, and walks with wicked men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For he has said, It profits a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore listen to me you men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For the work of a man shall he render to him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Yes, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Who has given him a charge over the earth? or who has disposed the whole world?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If he set his heart on man, if he gather to himself his spirit and his breath;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again to dust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">If now you have understanding, hear this: listen to the voice of my words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Shall even he that hates right govern? and will you condemn him that is most just?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Is it fit to say to a king, You are wicked? and to princes, You are ungodly?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">How much less to him that accepts not the persons of princes, nor regards the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For his eyes are on the ways of man, and he sees all his goings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For he will not lay on man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Therefore he knows their works, and he overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He strikes them as wicked men in the open sight of others;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">So that they cause the cry of the poor to come to him, and he hears the cry of the afflicted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">When he gives quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hides his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Surely it is meet to be said to God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">That which I see not teach you me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Should it be according to your mind? he will recompense it, whether you refuse, or whether you choose; and not I: therefore speak what you know.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man listen to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Job has spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">My desire is that Job may be tried to the end because of his answers for wicked men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">For he adds rebellion to his sin, he clapps his hands among us, and multiplies his words against God.</p>
