  <verse number="1">And it came to pass thereafter, that he was going through every city and village, preaching and proclaiming good news of the reign of God, and the twelve are with him,</verse>
  <verse number="2">and certain women, who were healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary who is called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone forth,</verse>
  <verse number="3">and Joanna wife of Chuza, steward of Herod, and Susanna, and many others, who were ministering to him from their substance.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And a great multitude having gathered, and those who from city and city were coming unto him, he spake by a simile:</verse>
  <verse number="5">‘The sower went forth to sow his seed, and in his sowing some indeed fell beside the way, and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the heaven did devour it.</verse>
  <verse number="6">‘And other fell upon the rock, and having sprung up, it did wither, through not having moisture.</verse>
  <verse number="7">‘And other fell amidst the thorns, and the thorns having sprung up with it, did choke it.</verse>
  <verse number="8">‘And other fell upon the good ground, and having sprung up, it made fruit an hundred fold.’ These things saying, he was calling, ‘He having ears to hear—let him hear.’</verse>
  <verse number="9">And his disciples were questioning him, saying, ‘What may this simile be?’</verse>
  <verse number="10">And he said, ‘To you it hath been given to know the secrets of the reign of God, and to the rest in similes; that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.</verse>
  <verse number="11">‘And this is the simile: The seed is the word of God,</verse>
  <verse number="12">and those beside the way are those hearing, then cometh the Devil, and taketh up the word from their heart, lest having believed, they may be saved.</verse>
  <verse number="13">‘And those upon the rock: They who, when they may hear, with joy do receive the word, and these have no root, who for a time believe, and in time of temptation fall away.</verse>
  <verse number="14">‘And that which fell to the thorns: These are they who have heard, and going forth, through anxieties, and riches, and pleasures of life, are choked, and bear not to completion.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And that in the good ground: These are they, who in an upright and good heart, having heard the word, do retain it, and bear fruit in continuance.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And no one having lighted a lamp doth cover it with a vessel, or under a couch doth put it; but upon a lamp-stand he doth put it, that those coming in may see the light,</verse>
  <verse number="17">for nothing is secret, that shall not become manifest, nor hid, that shall not be known, and become manifest.</verse>
  <verse number="18">‘See, therefore, how ye hear, for whoever may have, there shall be given to him, and whoever may not have, also what he seemeth to have, shall be taken from him.’</verse>
  <verse number="19">And there came unto him his mother and brethren, and they were not able to get to him because of the multitude,</verse>
  <verse number="20">and it was told him, saying, ‘Thy mother and thy brethren do stand without, wishing to see thee;’</verse>
  <verse number="21">and he answering said unto them, ‘My mother and my brethren! they are those who the word of God are hearing, and doing.’</verse>
  <verse number="22">And it came to pass, on one of the days, that he himself went into a boat with his disciples, and he said unto them, ‘We may go over to the other side of the lake;’ and they set forth,</verse>
  <verse number="23">and as they are sailing he fell deeply asleep, and there came down a storm of wind to the lake, and they were filling, and were in peril.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And having come near, they awoke him, saying, ‘Master, master, we perish;’ and he, having arisen, rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and there came a calm,</verse>
  <verse number="25">and he said to them, ‘Where is your faith?’ and they being afraid did wonder, saying unto one another, ‘Who, then, is this, that even the winds he doth command, and the water, and they obey him?’</verse>
  <verse number="26">And they sailed down to the region of the Gadarenes, that is over-against Galilee,</verse>
  <verse number="27">and he having gone forth upon the land, there met him a certain man, out of the city, who had demons for a long time, and with a garment was not clothed, and in a house was not abiding, but in the tombs,</verse>
  <verse number="28">and having seen Jesus, and having cried out, he fell before him, and with a loud voice, said, ‘What—to me and to thee, Jesus, Son of God Most High? I beseech thee, mayest thou not afflict me!’</verse>
  <verse number="29">For he commanded the unclean spirit to come forth from the man, for many times it had caught him, and he was being bound with chains and fetters—guarded, and breaking asunder the bonds he was driven by the demons to the deserts.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And Jesus questioned him, saying, ‘What is thy name?’ and he said, ‘Legion,’ (because many demons were entered into him,)</verse>
  <verse number="31">and he was calling on him, that he may not command them to go away to the abyss,</verse>
  <verse number="32">and there was there a herd of many swine feeding in the mountain, and they were calling on him, that he might suffer them to enter into these, and he suffered them,</verse>
  <verse number="33">and the demons having gone forth from the man, did enter into the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep to the lake, and were choked.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And those feeding them, having seen what was come to pass, fled, and having gone, told it to the city, and to the fields;</verse>
  <verse number="35">and they came forth to see what was come to pass, and they came unto Jesus, and found the man sitting, out of whom the demons had gone forth, clothed, and right-minded, at the feet of Jesus, and they were afraid;</verse>
  <verse number="36">and those also having seen it, told them how the demoniac was saved.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And the whole multitude of the region of the Gadarenes round about asked him to go away from them, because with great fear they were pressed, and he having entered into the boat, did turn back.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And the man from whom the demons had gone forth was beseeching of him to be with him, and Jesus sent him away, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="39">‘Turn back to thy house, and tell how great things God did to thee;’ and he went away through all the city proclaiming how great things Jesus did to him.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And it came to pass, in the turning back of Jesus, the multitude received him, for they were all looking for him,</verse>
  <verse number="41">and lo, there came a man, whose name is Jairus, and he was a chief of the synagogue, and having fallen at the feet of Jesus, was calling on him to come to his house;</verse>
  <verse number="42">because he had an only daughter about twelve years old, and she was dying. And in his going away, the multitudes were thronging him,</verse>
  <verse number="43">and a woman, having an issue of blood for twelve years, who, having spent on physicians all her living, was not able to be healed by any,</verse>
  <verse number="44">having come near behind, touched the fringe of his garment, and presently the issue of her blood stood.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And Jesus said, ‘Who is it that touched me?’ and all denying, Peter and those with him said, ‘Master, the multitudes press thee, and throng thee, and thou dost say, Who is it that touched me!’</verse>
  <verse number="46">And Jesus said, ‘Some one did touch me, for I knew power having gone forth from me.’</verse>
  <verse number="47">And the woman, having seen that she was not hid, trembling, came, and having fallen before him, for what cause she touched him declared to him before all the people, and how she was healed presently;</verse>
  <verse number="48">and he said to her, ‘Take courage, daughter, thy faith hath saved thee, be going on to peace.’</verse>
  <verse number="49">While he is yet speaking, there doth come a certain one from the chief of the synagogue’s house, saying to him—‘Thy daughter hath died, harass not the Teacher;’</verse>
  <verse number="50">and Jesus having heard, answered him, saying, ‘Be not afraid, only believe, and she shall be saved.’</verse>
  <verse number="51">And having come to the house, he suffered no one to go in, except Peter, and James, and John, and the father of the child, and the mother;</verse>
  <verse number="52">and they were all weeping, and beating themselves for her, and he said, ‘Weep not, she did not die, but doth sleep;</verse>
  <verse number="53">and they were deriding him, knowing that she did die;</verse>
  <verse number="54">and he having put all forth without, and having taken hold of her hand, called, saying, ‘Child, arise;’</verse>
  <verse number="55">and her spirit came back, and she arose presently, and he directed that there be given to her to eat;</verse>
  <verse number="56">and her parents were amazed, but he charged them to say to no one what was come to pass.</verse>
