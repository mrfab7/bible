<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Truth I say in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing testimony with me in the Holy Spirit,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">that I have great grief and unceasing pain in my heart—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">for I was wishing, I myself, to be anathema from the Christ—for my brethren, my kindred, according to the flesh,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">who are Israelites, whose is the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the lawgiving, and the service, and the promises,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">whose are the fathers, and of whom is the Christ, according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed to the ages. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And it is not possible that the word of God hath failed; for not all who are of Israel are these Israel;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">nor because they are seed of Abraham are all children, but—‘in Isaac shall a seed be called to thee;’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">that is, the children of the flesh—these are not children of God; but the children of the promise are reckoned for seed;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">for the word of promise is this; ‘According to this time I will come, and there shall be to Sarah a son.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And not only so, but also Rebecca, having conceived by one—Isaac our father—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">(for they being not yet born, neither having done anything good or evil, that the purpose of God, according to choice, might remain; not of works, but of Him who is calling,) it was said to her—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">‘The greater shall serve the less;’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">according as it hath been written, ‘Jacob I did love, and Esau I did hate.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">What, then, shall we say? unrighteousness is with God? let it not be!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">for to Moses He saith, ‘I will do kindness to whom I do kindness, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion;’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">so, then—not of him who is willing, nor of him who is running, but of God who is doing kindness:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">for the Writing saith to Pharaoh—‘For this very thing I did raise thee up, that I might shew in thee My power, and that My name might be declared in all the land;’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">so, then, to whom He willeth, He doth kindness, and to whom He willeth, He doth harden.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Thou wilt say, then, to me, ‘Why yet doth He find fault? for His counsel who hath resisted?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">nay, but, O man, who art thou that art answering again to God? shall the thing formed say to Him who did form it, Why me didst thou make thus?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">hath not the potter authority over the clay, out of the same lump to make the one vessel to honour, and the one to dishonour?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And if God, willing to shew the wrath and to make known His power, did endure, in much long suffering, vessels of wrath fitted for destruction,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">and that He might make known the riches of His glory on vessels of kindness, that He before prepared for glory, whom also He did call—us—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">not only out of Jews, but also out of nations,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">as also in Hosea He saith, ‘I will call what is not My people—My people; and her not beloved—Beloved,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">and it shall be—in the place where it was said to them, Ye are not My people; there they shall be called sons of the living God.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And Isaiah doth cry concerning Israel, ‘If the number of the sons of Israel may be as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">for a matter He is finishing, and is cutting short in righteousness, because a matter cut short will the Lord do upon the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">and according as Isaiah saith before, ‘Except the Lord of Sabaoth did leave to us a seed, as Sodom we had become, and as Gomorrah we had been made like.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">What, then, shall we say? that nations who are not pursuing righteousness did attain to righteousness, and righteousness that is of faith,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">and Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, at a law of righteousness did not arrive;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">wherefore? because—not by faith, but as by works of law; for they did stumble at the stone of stumbling,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">according as it hath been written, ‘Lo, I place in Sion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence; and every one who is believing thereon shall not be ashamed.’</p>
