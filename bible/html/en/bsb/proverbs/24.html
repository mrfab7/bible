<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Do not envy wicked men or desire their company;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">for their hearts devise violence, and their lips declare trouble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">By wisdom a house is built and by understanding it is established;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">through knowledge its rooms are filled with every precious and beautiful treasure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">A wise man is strong, and a man of knowledge enhances his strength.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Only with sound guidance should you wage war, and victory lies in a multitude of counselors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Wisdom is too high for a fool; he does not open his mouth in the meeting place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He who plots evil will be called a schemer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">A foolish scheme is sin, and a mocker is detestable to men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">If you faint in the day of distress, how small is your strength!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Rescue those being led away to death, and restrain those stumbling toward the slaughter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">If you say, “Behold, we did not know about this,” does not He who weighs hearts consider it? Does not the One who guards your life know? Will He not repay a man according to his deeds?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Eat honey, my son, for it is good, and the honeycomb is sweet to your taste.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Know therefore that wisdom is sweet to your soul. If you find it, there is a future for you, and your hope will never be cut off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Do not lie in wait, O wicked man, near the dwelling of the righteous; do not destroy his resting place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For though a righteous man may fall seven times, he still gets up; but the wicked stumble in bad times.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Do not gloat when your enemy falls, and do not let your heart rejoice when he stumbles,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">or the LORD will see and disapprove, and turn His wrath away from him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Do not fret over evildoers, and do not be envious of the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For the evil man has no future; the lamp of the wicked will be extinguished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">My son, fear the LORD and the king, and do not associate with the rebellious.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For they will bring sudden destruction. Who knows what ruin they can bring?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">These also are sayings of the wise: To show partiality in judgment is not good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Whoever tells the guilty, “You are innocent”—peoples will curse him, and nations will denounce him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">but it will go well with those who convict the guilty, and rich blessing will come upon them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">An honest answer given is like a kiss on the lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Complete your outdoor work and prepare your field; after that, you may build your house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Do not testify against your neighbor without cause, and do not deceive with your lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Do not say, “I will do to him as he has done to me; I will repay the man according to his work.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">I went past the field of a slacker and by the vineyard of a man lacking judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Thorns had grown up everywhere, thistles had covered the ground, and the stone wall was broken down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">I observed and took it to heart; I looked and received instruction:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and need like a bandit.</p>
