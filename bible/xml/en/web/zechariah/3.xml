  <verse number="1">He showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of Yahweh, and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Yahweh said to Satan, “Yahweh rebuke you, Satan! Yes, Yahweh who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Isn’t this a burning stick plucked out of the fire?”</verse>
  <verse number="3">Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the angel.</verse>
  <verse number="4">He answered and spoke to those who stood before him, saying, “Take the filthy garments off of him.” To him he said, “Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you, and I will clothe you with rich clothing.”</verse>
  <verse number="5">I said, “Let them set a clean turban on his head.” So they set a clean turban on his head, and clothed him; and the angel of Yahweh was standing by.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The angel of Yahweh protested to Joshua, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="7">“Thus says Yahweh of Armies: ‘If you will walk in my ways, and if you will follow my instructions, then you also shall judge my house, and shall also keep my courts, and I will give you a place of access among these who stand by.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Hear now, Joshua the high priest, you and your fellows who sit before you; for they are men who are a sign: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant, the Branch.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For, behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes: behold, I will engrave its engraving,’ says Yahweh of Armies, ‘and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.</verse>
  <verse number="10">In that day,’ says Yahweh of Armies, ‘you will invite every man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree.’”</verse>
