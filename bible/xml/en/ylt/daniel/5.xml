<chapter book="Daniel" number="5" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Belshazzar the king hath made a great feast to a thousand of his great men, and before the thousand he is drinking wine;</verse>
  <verse number="2">Belshazzar hath said—while tasting the wine—to bring in the vessels of gold and of silver that Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken from the temple that is in Jerusalem, that drink with them may the king, and his great men, his wives, and his concubines.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Then they have brought in the vessels of gold that had been taken out of the temple of the house of God that is in Jerusalem, and drunk with them have the king and his great men, his wives and his concubines;</verse>
  <verse number="4">they have drunk wine, and have praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.</verse>
  <verse number="5">In that hour come forth have fingers of a man’s hand, and they are writing over-against the candlestick, on the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace: and the king is seeing the extremity of the hand that is writing;</verse>
  <verse number="6">then the king’s countenance hath changed, and his thoughts do trouble him, and the joints of his loins are loosed, and his knees are smiting one against another.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Call doth the king mightily, to bring up the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. Answered hath the king, and said to the wise men of Babylon, that, ‘Any man who doth read this writing, and its interpretation doth shew me, purple he putteth on, and a bracelet of gold is on his neck, and third in the kingdom he doth rule.’</verse>
  <verse number="8">Then coming up are all the wise men of the king, and they are not able to read the writing, and the interpretation to make known to the king;</verse>
  <verse number="9">then the king Belshazzar is greatly troubled, and his countenance is changing in him, and his great men are perplexed.</verse>
  <verse number="10">The queen, on account of the words of the king and his great men, to the banquet-house hath come up. Answered hath the queen, and said, ‘O king, to the ages live; let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor thy countenance be changed:</verse>
  <verse number="11">there is a man in thy kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and, in the days of thy father, light, and understanding, and wisdom—as the wisdom of the gods—was found in him; and king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, chief of the scribes, enchanters, Chaldeans, soothsayers, established him—thy father, O king—</verse>
  <verse number="12">because that an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and showing of enigmas, and loosing of knots was found in him, in Daniel, whose name the king made Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and the interpretation he doth show.’</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then Daniel hath been caused to come up before the king; answered hath the king, and said to Daniel, ‘Thou art that Daniel who art of the sons of the Removed of Judah, whom the king my father brought in out of Judah?</verse>
  <verse number="14">And I have heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and light, and understanding, and excellent wisdom have been found in thee.</verse>
  <verse number="15">‘And now, caused to come up before me have been the wise men, the enchanters, that this writing they may read, and its interpretation to cause me to know: and they are not able to shew the interpretation of the thing:</verse>
  <verse number="16">and I—I have heard of thee, that thou art able to give interpretations, and to loose knots: now, lo—thou art able to read the writing, and its interpretation to cause me to know—purple thou dost put on, and a bracelet of gold is on thy neck, and third in the kingdom thou dost rule.’</verse>
  <verse number="17">Then hath Daniel answered and said before the king, ‘Thy gifts be to thyself, and thy fee to another give; nevertheless, the writing I do read to the king, and the interpretation I cause him to know;</verse>
  <verse number="18">thou, O king, God Most High, a kingdom, and greatness, and glory, and honour, gave to Nebuchadnezzar thy father:</verse>
  <verse number="19">and because of the greatness that He gave to him, all peoples, nations, and languages were trembling and fearing before him: whom he willed he was slaying, and whom he willed he was keeping alive, and whom he willed he was raising up, and whom he willed he was making low;</verse>
  <verse number="20">and when his heart was high, and his spirit was strong to act proudly, he hath been caused to come down from the throne of his kingdom, and his glory they have caused to pass away from him,</verse>
  <verse number="21">and from the sons of men he is driven, and his heart with the beasts hath been like, and with the wild asses is his dwelling; the herb like oxen they cause him to eat, and by the dew of the heavens is his body wet, till that he hath known that God Most High is ruler in the kingdom of men, and whom He willeth He raiseth up over it.</verse>
  <verse number="22">‘And thou, his son, Belshazzar, hast not humbled thy heart, though all this thou hast known;</verse>
  <verse number="23">and against the Lord of the heavens thou hast lifted up thyself; and the vessels of His house they have brought in before thee, and thou, and thy great men, thy wives, and thy concubines, are drinking wine with them, and gods of silver, and of gold, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone, that are not seeing, nor hearing, nor knowing, thou hast praised: and the God in whose hand is thy breath, and all thy ways, Him thou hast not honoured.</verse>
  <verse number="24">‘Then from before Him sent is the extremity of the hand, and the writing is noted down;</verse>
  <verse number="25">and this is the writing that is noted down: Numbered, Numbered, Weighed, and Divided.</verse>
  <verse number="26">This is the interpretation of the thing: Numbered—God hath numbered thy kingdom, and hath finished it.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Weighed—Thou art weighed in the balances, and hast been found lacking.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Divided—Divided is thy kingdom, and it hath been given to the Medes and Persians.’</verse>
  <verse number="29">Then hath Belshazzar said, and they have clothed Daniel with purple, and a bracelet of gold is on his neck, and they have proclaimed concerning him that he is the third ruler in the kingdom.</verse>
  <verse number="30">In that night Belshazzar king of the Chaldeans is slain,</verse>
  <verse number="31">and Darius the Mede hath received the kingdom, when a son of sixty and two years.</verse>
