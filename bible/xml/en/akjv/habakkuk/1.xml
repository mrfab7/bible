<chapter book="Habakkuk" number="1" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.</verse>
  <verse number="2">O LORD, how long shall I cry, and you will not hear! even cry out to you of violence, and you will not save!</verse>
  <verse number="3">Why do you show me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there are that raise up strife and contention.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment does never go forth: for the wicked does compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceeds.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Behold you among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvelously: for I will work a work in your days which you will not believe, though it be told you.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For, see, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwelling places that are not theirs.</verse>
  <verse number="7">They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle that hastens to eat.</verse>
  <verse number="9">They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn to them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, imputing this his power to his god.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Are you not from everlasting, O LORD my God, my Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, you have ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, you have established them for correction.</verse>
  <verse number="13">You are of purer eyes than to behold evil, and can not look on iniquity: why look you on them that deal treacherously, and hold your tongue when the wicked devours the man that is more righteous than he?</verse>
  <verse number="14">And make men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?</verse>
  <verse number="15">They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Therefore they sacrifice to their net, and burn incense to their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their meat plenteous.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?</verse>
