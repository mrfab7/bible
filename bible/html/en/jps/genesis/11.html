<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And it came to pass, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And they said one to another: ‘Come, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly.’ And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And they said: ‘Come, let us build us a city, and a tower, with its top in heaven, and let us make us a name; lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the LORD said: ‘Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is what they begin to do; and now nothing will be withholden from them, which they purpose to do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth; and they left off to build the city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Therefore was the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth; and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">These are the generations of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old, and begot Arpachshad two years after the flood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And Shem lived after he begot Arpachshad five hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And Arpachshad lived five and thirty years, and begot Shelah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And Arpachshad lived after he begot Shelah four hundred and three years, and begot sons and daughters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Shelah lived thirty years, and begot Eber.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Shelah lived after he begot Eber four hundred and three years, and begot sons and daughters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begot Peleg.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And Eber lived after he begot Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and daughters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And Peleg lived thirty years, and begot Reu.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And Peleg lived after he begot Reu two hundred and nine years, and begot sons and daughters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begot Serug.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Reu lived after he begot Serug two hundred and seven years, and begot sons and daughters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Serug lived thirty years, and begot Nahor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And Serug lived after he begot Nahor two hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begot Terah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And Nahor lived after he begot Terah a hundred and nineteen years, and begot sons and daughters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And Terah lived seventy years, and begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begot Lot.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And Haran died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram’s wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And Sarai was barren; she had no child.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years; and Terah died in Haran.</p>
