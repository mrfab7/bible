  <verse number="1">The Song of songs, which is Solomon’s.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth; For thy love is better than wine.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Thine oils have a goodly fragrance; Thy name is as oil poured forth; Therefore do the virgins love thee.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Draw me; we will run after thee: The king hath brought me into his chambers; We will be glad and rejoice in thee; We will make mention of thy love more than of wine: Rightly do they love thee.</verse>
  <verse number="5">I am black, but comely, Oh ye daughters of Jerusalem, As the tents of Kedar, As the curtains of Solomon.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Look not upon me, because I am swarthy, Because the sun hath scorched me. My mother’s sons were incensed against me; They made me keeper of the vineyards; But mine own vineyard have I not kept.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, Where thou feedest thy flock, Where thou makest it to rest at noon: For why should I be as one that is veiled Beside the flocks of thy companions?</verse>
  <verse number="8">If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, Go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, And feed thy kids beside the shepherds’ tents.</verse>
  <verse number="9">I have compared thee, O my love, To a steed in Pharaoh’s chariots.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Thy cheeks are comely with plaits of hair, Thy neck with strings of jewels.</verse>
  <verse number="11">We will make thee plaits of gold With studs of silver.</verse>
  <verse number="12">While the king sat at his table, My spikenard sent forth its fragrance.</verse>
  <verse number="13">My beloved is unto me as a bundle of myrrh, That lieth betwixt my breasts.</verse>
  <verse number="14">My beloved is unto me as a cluster of henna-flowers In the vineyards of En-gedi.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Behold, thou art fair, my love; Behold thou art fair; Thine eyes are as doves.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: Also our couch is green.</verse>
  <verse number="17">The beams of our house are cedars, And our rafters are firs.</verse>
