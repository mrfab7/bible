<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Timothy" data-chapter="3" data-translation="Darby Bible Translation" data-translation-id="dbt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The word [is] faithful: if any one aspires to exercise oversight, he desires a good work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The overseer then must be irreproachable, husband of one wife, sober, discreet, decorous, hospitable, apt to teach;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">not given to excesses from wine, not a striker, but mild, not addicted to contention, not fond of money,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">conducting his own house well, having [his] children in subjection with all gravity;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">(but if one does not know how to conduct his own house, how shall he take care of the assembly of God?)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">not a novice, that he may not, being inflated, fall into [the] fault of the devil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But it is necessary that he should have also a good testimony from those without, that he may fall not into reproach and [the] snare of the devil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Ministers, in like manner, grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not seeking gain by base means,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And let these be first proved, then let them minister, being without charge [against them].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">[The] women in like manner grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Let [the] ministers be husbands of one wife, conducting [their] children and their own houses well:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">for those who shall have ministered well obtain for themselves a good degree, and much boldness in faith which [is] in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">These things I write to thee, hoping to come to thee more quickly;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">but if I delay, in order that thou mayest know how one ought to conduct oneself in God’s house, which is [the] assembly of [the] living God, [the] pillar and base of the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And confessedly the mystery of piety is great. God has been manifested in flesh, has been justified in [the] Spirit, has appeared to angels, has been preached among [the] nations, has been believed on in [the] world, has been received up in glory.</p>
