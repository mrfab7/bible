<p class="verse" data-verse="1">James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If any of you lacketh wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing from the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">A man unsettled in his opinions is unstable in all his ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For the sun hath no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and its flower falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted by God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own lust, and enticed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Do not err, my beloved brethren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Of his own will he hath begotten us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first-fruits of his creatures.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For if any is a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like a man beholding his natural face in a glass:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For he beholdeth himself, and goeth away, and immediately forgetteth what manner of man he was.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">But he who looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth in it, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">If any man among you seemeth to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this manâ€™s religion is vain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.</p>
