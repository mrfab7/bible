  <verse number="1">Call now; is there any that will answer thee? And to which of the holy ones wilt thou turn?</verse>
  <verse number="2">For anger killeth the foolish man, And envy slayeth the silly one.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I have seen the foolish taking root; But suddenly I beheld his habitation cursed.</verse>
  <verse number="4">His children are far from safety, And are crushed in the gate, with none to deliver them.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, And taketh it even out of the thorns, and the snare gapeth for their substance.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For affliction cometh not forth from the dust, Neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;</verse>
  <verse number="7">But man is born unto trouble, As the sparks fly upward.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But as for me, I would seek unto God, And unto God would I commit my cause;</verse>
  <verse number="9">Who doeth great things and unsearchable, Marvellous things without number;</verse>
  <verse number="10">Who giveth rain upon the earth, And sendeth waters upon the fields;</verse>
  <verse number="11">So that He setteth up on high those that are low, And those that mourn are exalted to safety.</verse>
  <verse number="12">He frustrateth the devices of the crafty, So that their hands can perform nothing substantial.</verse>
  <verse number="13">He taketh the wise in their own craftiness; And the counsel of the wily is carried headlong.</verse>
  <verse number="14">They meet with darkness in the day-time, And grope at noonday as in the night.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But He saveth from the sword of their mouth, Even the needy from the hand of the mighty.</verse>
  <verse number="16">So the poor hath hope, And iniquity stoppeth her mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth; Therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For He maketh sore, and bindeth up; He woundeth, and His hands make whole.</verse>
  <verse number="19">He will deliver thee in six troubles; Yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.</verse>
  <verse number="20">In famine He will redeem thee from death; And in war from the power of the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue; Neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.</verse>
  <verse number="22">At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh; Neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field; And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And thou shalt know that thy tent is in peace; And thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt miss nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, And thine offspring as the grass of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Thou shalt come to thy grave in a ripe age, Like as a shock of corn cometh in in its season.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Lo this, we have searched it, So it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good.</verse>
