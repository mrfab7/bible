<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="10" data-translation="Young's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="ylt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Proverbs of Solomon. A wise son causeth a father to rejoice, And a foolish son is an affliction to his mother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Treasures of wickedness profit not, And righteousness delivereth from death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Jehovah causeth not the soul of the righteous to hunger, And the desire of the wicked He thrusteth away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Poor is he who is working—a slothful hand, And the hand of the diligent maketh rich.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Whoso is gathering in summer is a wise son, Whoso is sleeping in harvest is a son causing shame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Blessings are for the head of the righteous, And the mouth of the wicked cover doth violence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The remembrance of the righteous is for a blessing, And the name of the wicked doth rot.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The wise in heart accepteth commands, And a talkative fool kicketh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Whoso is walking in integrity walketh confidently, And whoso is perverting his ways is known.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Whoso is winking the eye giveth grief, And a talkative fool kicketh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">A fountain of life is the mouth of the righteous, And the mouth of the wicked cover doth violence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Hatred awaketh contentions, And over all transgressions love covereth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">In the lips of the intelligent is wisdom found, And a rod is for the back of him who is lacking understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The wise lay up knowledge, and the mouth of a fool is near ruin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The wealth of the rich is his strong city, The ruin of the poor is their poverty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The wage of the righteous is for life, The increase of the wicked for sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">A traveller to life is he who is keeping instruction, And whoso is forsaking rebuke is erring.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Whoso is covering hatred with lying lips, And whoso is bringing out an evil report is a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">In the abundance of words transgression ceaseth not, And whoso is restraining his lips is wise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The tongue of the righteous is chosen silver, The heart of the wicked—as a little thing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">The lips of the righteous delight many, And fools for lack of heart die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The blessing of Jehovah—it maketh rich, And He addeth no grief with it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">To execute inventions is as play to a fool, And wisdom to a man of understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The feared thing of the wicked it meeteth him, And the desire of the righteous is given.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">As the passing by of a hurricane, So the wicked is not, And the righteous is a foundation age-during.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">As vinegar to the teeth, And as smoke to the eyes, So is the slothful to those sending him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The fear of Jehovah addeth days, And the years of the wicked are shortened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">The hope of the righteous is joyful, And the expectation of the wicked perisheth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">The way of Jehovah is strength to the perfect, And ruin to workers of iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">The righteous to the age is not moved, And the wicked inhabit not the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">The mouth of the righteous uttereth wisdom, And the tongue of frowardness is cut out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">The lips of the righteous know a pleasing thing, And the mouth of the wicked perverseness!</p>
