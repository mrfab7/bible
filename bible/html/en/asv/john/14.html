<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Let not your heart be troubled: believe in God, believe also in me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">In my Father’s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And if I go and prepare a place for you, I come again, and will receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And whither I go, ye know the way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; how know we the way?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no one cometh unto the Father, but by me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">If ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also: from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and dost thou not know me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; how sayest thou, Show us the Father?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I say unto you I speak not from myself: but the Father abiding in me doeth his works.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works’ sake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto the Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If ye shall ask anything in my name, that will I do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">If ye love me, ye will keep my commandments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">even the Spirit of truth: whom the world cannot receive; for it beholdeth him not, neither knoweth him: ye know him; for he abideth with you, and shall be in you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">I will not leave you desolate: I come unto you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Yet a little while, and the world beholdeth me no more; but ye behold me: because I live, ye shall live also.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself unto him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Judas (not Iscariot) saith unto him, Lord, what is come to pass that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my word: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He that loveth me not keepeth not my words: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father’s who sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">These things have I spoken unto you, while yet abiding with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">But the Comforter, even the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said unto you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Ye heard how I said to you, I go away, and I come unto you. If ye loved me, ye would have rejoiced, because I go unto the Father: for the Father is greater than I.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">I will no more speak much with you, for the prince of the world cometh: and he hath nothing in me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">but that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.</p>
