<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then shall the kingdom of the heavens be made like to ten virgins that having taken their torches, went forth to meet the bridegroom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And five of them were prudent and five foolish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">They that were foolish took their torches and did not take oil with them;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">but the prudent took oil in their vessels with their torches.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Now the bridegroom tarrying, they all grew heavy and slept.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But in [the] middle of [the] night there was a cry, Behold, the bridegroom; go forth to meet him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their torches.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the foolish said to the prudent, Give us of your oil, for our torches are going out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But the prudent answered saying, [We cannot,] lest it might not suffice for us and for you. Go rather to those that sell, and buy for yourselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But as they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and the [ones that were] ready went in with him to the wedding feast, and the door was shut.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Afterwards come also the rest of the virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">but he answering said, Verily I say unto you, I do not know you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Watch therefore, for ye know not the day nor the hour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For [it is] as [if] a man going away out of a country called his own bondmen and delivered to them his substance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to each according to his particular ability, and immediately went away out of the country.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And he that had received the five talents went and trafficked with them, and made five other talents.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">In like manner also he that [had received] the two, [he also] gained two others.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But he that had received the one went and dug in the earth, and hid the money of his lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And after a long time the lord of those bondmen comes and reckons with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And he that had received the five talents came to [him] and brought five other talents, saying, [My] lord, thou deliveredst me five talents; behold, I have gained five other talents besides them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">His lord said to him, Well, good and faithful bondman, thou wast faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things: enter into the joy of thy lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And he also that had received the two talents came to [him] and said, [My] lord, thou deliveredst me two talents; behold, I have gained two other talents besides them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">His lord said to him, Well, good and faithful bondman, thou wast faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And he also that had received the one talent coming to [him] said, [My] lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou hadst not sowed, and gathering from where thou hadst not scattered,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">and being afraid I went away and hid thy talent in the earth; behold, thou hast that which is thine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And his lord answering said to him, Wicked and slothful bondman, thou knewest that I reap where I had not sowed, and gather from where I had not scattered;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">thou oughtest then to have put my money to the money-changers, and when I came I should have got what is mine with interest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Take therefore the talent from him, and give it to him that has the ten talents:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">for to every one that has shall be given, and he shall be in abundance; but from him that has not, that even which he has shall be taken from him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And cast out the useless bondman into the outer darkness; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">But when the Son of man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit down upon his throne of glory,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">and all the nations shall be gathered before him; and he shall separate them from one another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">and he will set the sheep on his right hand, and the goats on [his] left.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Then shall the King say to those on his right hand, Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from [the] worldâ€™s foundation:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">for I hungered, and ye gave me to eat; I thirsted, and ye gave me to drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">naked, and ye clothed me; I was ill, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">Then shall the righteous answer him saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungering, and nourished thee; or thirsting, and gave thee to drink?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">and when saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in; or naked, and clothed thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">and when saw we thee ill, or in prison, and came to thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And the King answering shall say to them, Verily, I say to you, Inasmuch as ye have done it to one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Then shall he say also to those on the left, Go from me, cursed, into eternal fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">for I hungered, and ye gave me not to eat; I thirsted, and ye gave me not to drink;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">I was a stranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye did not clothe me; ill, and in prison, and ye did not visit me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">Then shall they also answer saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungering, or thirsting, or a stranger, or naked, or ill, or in prison, and have not ministered to thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">Then shall he answer them saying, Verily I say to you, Inasmuch as ye have not done it to one of these least, neither have ye done it to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">And these shall go away into eternal punishment, and the righteous into life eternal.</p>
