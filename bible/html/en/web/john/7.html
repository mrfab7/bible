<p class="verse" data-verse="1">After these things, Jesus was walking in Galilee, for he wouldn’t walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was at hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">His brothers therefore said to him, “Depart from here, and go into Judea, that your disciples also may see your works which you do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For no one does anything in secret, and himself seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For even his brothers didn’t believe in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Jesus therefore said to them, “My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The world can’t hate you, but it hates me, because I testify about it, that its works are evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">You go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, because my time is not yet fulfilled.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Having said these things to them, he stayed in Galilee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but as it were in secret.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, “Where is he?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">There was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him. Some said, “He is a good man.” Others said, “Not so, but he leads the multitude astray.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But when it was now the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The Jews therefore marveled, saying, “How does this man know letters, having never been educated?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Jesus therefore answered them, “My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">If anyone desires to do his will, he will know about the teaching, whether it is from God, or if I am speaking from myself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Didn’t Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill me?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The multitude answered, “You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Jesus answered them, “I did one work, and you all marvel because of it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a boy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">If a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me, because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Don’t judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Therefore some of them of Jerusalem said, “Isn’t this he whom they seek to kill?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly the Christ?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">However we know where this man comes from, but when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, “You both know me, and know where I am from. I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you don’t know.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">They sought therefore to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">But of the multitude, many believed in him. They said, “When the Christ comes, he won’t do more signs than those which this man has done, will he?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Then Jesus said, “I will be with you a little while longer, then I go to him who sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">You will seek me, and won’t find me; and where I am, you can’t come.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">The Jews therefore said among themselves, “Where will this man go that we won’t find him? Will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">What is this word that he said, ‘You will seek me, and won’t find me; and where I am, you can’t come’?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">Now on the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, from within him will flow rivers of living water.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">But he said this about the Spirit, which those believing in him were to receive. For the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus wasn’t yet glorified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">Many of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, “This is truly the prophet.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Others said, “This is the Christ.” But some said, “What, does the Christ come out of Galilee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">Hasn’t the Scripture said that the Christ comes of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">So there arose a division in the multitude because of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">Some of them would have arrested him, but no one laid hands on him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, “Why didn’t you bring him?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">The officers answered, “No man ever spoke like this man!”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">The Pharisees therefore answered them, “You aren’t also led astray, are you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">Have any of the rulers believed in him, or of the Pharisees?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">But this multitude that doesn’t know the law is accursed.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">Nicodemus (he who came to him by night, being one of them) said to them,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">“Does our law judge a man, unless it first hears from him personally and knows what he does?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="52">They answered him, “Are you also from Galilee? Search, and see that no prophet has arisen out of Galilee.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">Everyone went to his own house,</p>
