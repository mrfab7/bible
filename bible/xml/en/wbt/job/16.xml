  <verse number="1">Then Job answered and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?</verse>
  <verse number="4">I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul’s stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake my head at you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But I would strengthen you with my mouth and the moving of my lips should assuage your grief.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased?</verse>
  <verse number="7">But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; my enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.</verse>
  <verse number="10">They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves against me.</verse>
  <verse number="11">God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.</verse>
  <verse number="13">His archers encompass me; he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.</verse>
  <verse number="14">He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.</verse>
  <verse number="16">My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids are the shades of death;</verse>
  <verse number="17">Not for any injustice in my hands: also my prayer is pure.</verse>
  <verse number="18">O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.</verse>
  <verse number="20">My friends scorn me: but my eye poureth out tears to God.</verse>
  <verse number="21">O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbor!</verse>
  <verse number="22">When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return.</verse>
