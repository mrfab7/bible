<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Where has your beloved gone, you fairest among women? Where has your beloved turned, that we may seek him with you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">My beloved has gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I am my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine. He browses among the lilies,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">You are beautiful, my love, as Tirzah, lovely as Jerusalem, awesome as an army with banners.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Turn away your eyes from me, for they have overcome me. Your hair is like a flock of goats, that lie along the side of Gilead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Your teeth are like a flock of ewes, which have come up from the washing; of which every one has twins; none is bereaved among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind your veil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">There are sixty queens, eighty concubines, and virgins without number.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">My dove, my perfect one, is unique. She is her mother’s only daughter. She is the favorite one of her who bore her. The daughters saw her, and called her blessed; the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Who is she who looks forth as the morning, beautiful as the moon, clear as the sun, and awesome as an army with banners?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I went down into the nut tree grove, to see the green plants of the valley, to see whether the vine budded, and the pomegranates were in flower.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Without realizing it, my desire set me with my royal people’s chariots.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Return, return, Shulammite! Return, return, that we may gaze at you. Why do you desire to gaze at the Shulammite, as at the dance of Mahanaim?</p>
