<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the fifth angel sounded the trumpet, and I saw a star fallen from heaven to the earth: and there was given to him the key of the well of the bottomless pit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And he opened the well of the bottomless pit; and a smoke went up out of the well, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun was darkened, and the air, from the smoke of the well.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And out of the smoke came forth locusts into the earth: and power was given them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And it was said to them that they should not injure the grass of the earth, neither any green, nor any tree; except the men only which have not the seal of God upon their foreheads.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And it was given them that they should not kill them, but that they should be tortured five months: and their torture as the torture of a scorpion, when he should strike a man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And in those days shall men seek death, and not find it; and shall eagerly desire to die, and death shall flee from them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the likenesses of the locusts like horses prepared for war; and upon their heads as crowns like gold, and their faces as men’s faces.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And they had hair as women’s hair, and their teeth were as of lions.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And they had coats of mail, as coats of mail of iron; and the voice of their wings as the voice of chariots of many horses running to war.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And they have tails as scorpions, and goads were in their tails: and their power to injure men five months.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And they have a king over them, the angel of the abyss, the name to him in Hebrew Abaddon, and in Greek he has the name Apollyon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">One woe has passed; behold, there come two woes more after these.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And the sixth angel sounded the trumpet, and I heard one voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, Loose the four angels bound in the great river Euphrates.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And the four angels were loosed, prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, that they might kill the third of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And the number of troops of cavalry, two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard their number.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them sitting upon them, having fiery coats of mail, and of deep purple, and sulphurous: and the horses’ heads as lions’ heads; and out of their mouths went forth fire and smoke and sulphur.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">By these three were the third of men killed, from fire, and from smoke, and from brimstone, coming forth out of their mouths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For their powers are in their month, and in their tails: for their tails like serpents, having heads, and with them they injure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And the rest of men who were not killed by these blows, neither repented of the works of their hands, that they should not worship evil spirits, and images of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and wood: which neither can see, neither hear, neither walk:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And they repented not of their slaughters, nor of their charms, nor of their fornications, nor of their thefts.</p>
