<p class="verse" data-verse="1">A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, And loving favor rather than silver and gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The rich and the poor meet together: Jehovah is the maker of them all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A prudent man seeth the evil, and hideth himself; But the simple pass on, and suffer for it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The reward of humility and the fear of Jehovah Is riches, and honor, and life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Thorns and snares are in the way of the perverse: He that keepeth his soul shall be far from them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Train up a child in the way he should go, And even when he is old he will not depart from it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The rich ruleth over the poor; And the borrower is servant to the lender.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He that soweth iniquity shall reap calamity; And the rod of his wrath shall fail.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; For he giveth of his bread to the poor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Cast out the scoffer, and contention will go out; Yea, strife and ignominy will cease.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He that loveth pureness of heart, For the grace of his lips the king will be his friend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The eyes of Jehovah preserve him that hath knowledge; But he overthroweth the words of the treacherous man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The sluggard saith, There is a lion without; I shall be slain in the streets.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The mouth of strange women is a deep pit; He that is abhorred of Jehovah shall fall therein.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child; But the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He that oppresseth the poor to increase his gain, And he that giveth to the rich, shall come only to want.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Incline thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, And apply thy heart unto my knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee, If they be established together upon thy lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">That thy trust may be in Jehovah, I have made them known to thee this day, even to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Have not I written unto thee excellent things Of counsels and knowledge,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">To make thee know the certainty of the words of truth, That thou mayest carry back words of truth to them that send thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Rob not the poor, because he is poor; Neither oppress the afflicted in the gate:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For Jehovah will plead their cause, And despoil of life those that despoil them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Make no friendship with a man that is given to anger; And with a wrathful man thou shalt not go:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Lest thou learn this ways, And get a snare to thy soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Be thou not one of them that strike hands, Or of them that are sureties for debts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">If thou hast not wherewith to pay, Why should he take away thy bed from under thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Remove not the ancient landmark, Which thy fathers have set.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; He shall not stand before mean men.</p>
