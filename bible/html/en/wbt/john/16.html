<p class="verse" data-verse="1">These things have I spoken to you, that ye should not be offended.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">They shall put you out of the synagogues: yes, the time cometh, that whoever killeth you, will think that he doeth God service.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And these things will they do to you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not to you at the beginning, because I was with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But now I go to him that sent me, and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But because I have said these things to you, sorrow hath filled your heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: It is expedient for you that I depart; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send him to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Of sin, because they believe not on me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I have yet many things to say to you, but ye cannot bear them now.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But, when he, the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all the truth: for he will not speak from himself; but whatever he shall hear, that will he speak: and he will show you things to come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">He will glorify me: for he will receive of mine, and will show it to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore I said, that he will take of mine, and show it to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith to us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said to them, Do ye inquire among yourselves of that which I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Verily, verily, I say to you, that ye will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice: and ye will be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And in that day ye will ask me nothing: Verily, verily, I say to you, Whatever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">These things have I spoken to you in proverbs: but the time cometh when I shall no more speak to you in proverbs, but I shall show you plainly concerning the Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">At that day ye will ask in my name: and I say not to you, that I will pray the Father for you:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came from God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">His disciples said to him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest from God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Behold, the hour cometh, and is even now come, that ye shall be scattered every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">These things I have spoken to you, that in me ye may have peace. In the world ye will have tribulation, but be of good cheer: I have overcome the world.</p>
