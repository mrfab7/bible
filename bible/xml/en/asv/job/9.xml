  <verse number="1">Then Job answered and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Of a truth I know that it is so: But how can man be just with God?</verse>
  <verse number="3">If he be pleased to contend with him, He cannot answer him one of a thousand.</verse>
  <verse number="4">He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: Who hath hardened himself against him, and prospered?—</verse>
  <verse number="5">Him that removeth the mountains, and they know it not, When he overturneth them in his anger;</verse>
  <verse number="6">That shaketh the earth out of its place, And the pillars thereof tremble;</verse>
  <verse number="7">That commandeth the sun, and it riseth not, And sealeth up the stars;</verse>
  <verse number="8">That alone stretcheth out the heavens, And treadeth upon the waves of the sea;</verse>
  <verse number="9">That maketh the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, And the chambers of the south;</verse>
  <verse number="10">That doeth great things past finding out, Yea, marvellous things without number.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: He passeth on also, but I perceive him not.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Behold, he seizeth the prey, who can hinder him? Who will say unto him, What doest thou?</verse>
  <verse number="13">God will not withdraw his anger; The helpers of Rahab do stoop under him.</verse>
  <verse number="14">How much less shall I answer him, And choose out my words to reason with him?</verse>
  <verse number="15">Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer; I would make supplication to my judge.</verse>
  <verse number="16">If I had called, and he had answered me, Yet would I not believe that he hearkened unto my voice.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For he breaketh me with a tempest, And multiplieth my wounds without cause.</verse>
  <verse number="18">He will not suffer me to take my breath, But filleth me with bitterness.</verse>
  <verse number="19">If we speak of strength, lo, he is mighty! And if of justice, Who, saith he, will summon me?</verse>
  <verse number="20">Though I be righteous, mine own mouth shall condemn me: Though I be perfect, it shall prove me perverse.</verse>
  <verse number="21">I am perfect; I regard not myself; I despise my life.</verse>
  <verse number="22">It is all one; therefore I say, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.</verse>
  <verse number="23">If the scourge slay suddenly, He will mock at the trial of the innocent.</verse>
  <verse number="24">The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; He covereth the faces of the judges thereof: If it be not he, who then is it?</verse>
  <verse number="25">Now my days are swifter than a post: They flee away, they see no good,</verse>
  <verse number="26">They are passed away as the swift ships; As the eagle that swoopeth on the prey.</verse>
  <verse number="27">If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad countenance, and be of good cheer;</verse>
  <verse number="28">I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.</verse>
  <verse number="29">I shall be condemned; Why then do I labor in vain?</verse>
  <verse number="30">If I wash myself with snow water, And make my hands never so clean;</verse>
  <verse number="31">Yet wilt thou plunge me in the ditch, And mine own clothes shall abhor me.</verse>
  <verse number="32">For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, That we should come together in judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="33">There is no umpire betwixt us, That might lay his hand upon us both.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Let him take his rod away from me, And let not his terror make me afraid:</verse>
  <verse number="35">Then would I speak, and not fear him; For I am not so in myself.</verse>
