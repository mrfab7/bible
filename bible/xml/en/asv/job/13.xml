  <verse number="1">Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, Mine ear hath heard and understood it.</verse>
  <verse number="2">What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Surely I would speak to the Almighty, And I desire to reason with God.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But ye are forgers of lies; Ye are all physicians of no value.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Oh that ye would altogether hold your peace! And it would be your wisdom.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Hear now my reasoning, And hearken to the pleadings of my lips.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Will ye speak unrighteously for God, And talk deceitfully for him?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Will ye show partiality to him? Will ye contend for God?</verse>
  <verse number="9">Is it good that he should search you out? Or as one deceiveth a man, will ye deceive him?</verse>
  <verse number="10">He will surely reprove you, If ye do secretly show partiality.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Shall not his majesty make you afraid, And his dread fall upon you?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes, Your defences are defences of clay.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak; And let come on me what will.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Wherefore should I take my flesh in my teeth, And put my life in my hand?</verse>
  <verse number="15">Behold, he will slay me; I have no hope: Nevertheless I will maintain my ways before him.</verse>
  <verse number="16">This also shall be my salvation, That a godless man shall not come before him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Hear diligently my speech, And let my declaration be in your ears.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Behold now, I have set my cause in order; I know that I am righteous.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Who is he that will contend with me? For then would I hold my peace and give up the ghost.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Only do not two things unto me; Then will I not hide myself from thy face:</verse>
  <verse number="21">Withdraw thy hand far from me; And let not thy terror make me afraid.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Then call thou, and I will answer; Or let me speak, and answer thou me.</verse>
  <verse number="23">How many are mine iniquities and sins? Make me to know my transgression and my sin.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Wherefore hidest thou thy face, And holdest me for thine enemy?</verse>
  <verse number="25">Wilt thou harass a driven leaf? And wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?</verse>
  <verse number="26">For thou writest bitter things against me, And makest me to inherit the iniquities of my youth:</verse>
  <verse number="27">Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, And markest all my paths; Thou settest a bound to the soles of my feet:</verse>
  <verse number="28">Though I am like a rotten thing that consumeth, Like a garment that is moth-eaten.</verse>
