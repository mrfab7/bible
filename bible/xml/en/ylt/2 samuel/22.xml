<chapter book="2 Samuel" number="22" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And David speaketh to Jehovah the words of this song in the day Jehovah hath delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul,</verse>
  <verse number="2">and he saith: ‘Jehovah is my rock, And my bulwark, and a deliverer to me,</verse>
  <verse number="3">My God is my rock—I take refuge in Him; My shield, and the horn of my salvation, My high tower, and my refuge! My Saviour, from violence Thou savest me!</verse>
  <verse number="4">The Praised One, I call Jehovah: And from mine enemies I am saved.</verse>
  <verse number="5">When the breakers of death compassed me, The streams of the worthless terrify me,</verse>
  <verse number="6">The cords of Sheol have surrounded me, Before me have been the snares of death.</verse>
  <verse number="7">In mine adversity I call Jehovah, And unto my God I call, And He heareth from His temple my voice, And my cry is in His ears,</verse>
  <verse number="8">And shake and tremble doth the earth, Foundations of the heavens are troubled, And are shaken, for He hath wrath!</verse>
  <verse number="9">Gone up hath smoke by His nostrils. And fire from His mouth devoureth, Brands have been kindled by it.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And He inclineth heaven, and cometh down, And thick darkness is under His feet.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And He rideth on a cherub, and doth fly, And is seen on the wings of the wind.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And He setteth darkness Round about Him—tabernacles, Darkness of waters—thick clouds of the skies.</verse>
  <verse number="13">From the brightness before Him Were brands of fire kindled!</verse>
  <verse number="14">Thunder from the heavens doth Jehovah, And the Most High giveth forth His voice.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And He sendeth forth arrows, And scattereth them; Lightning, and troubleth them;</verse>
  <verse number="16">And seen are the streams of the sea, Revealed are foundations of the world, By the rebuke of Jehovah, From the breath of the spirit of His anger.</verse>
  <verse number="17">He sendeth from above—He taketh me, He draweth me out of many waters.</verse>
  <verse number="18">He delivereth me from my strong enemy, From those hating me, For they were stronger than I.</verse>
  <verse number="19">They are before me in a day of my calamity, And Jehovah is my support,</verse>
  <verse number="20">And He bringeth me out to a large place, He draweth me out for He delighted in me.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Jehovah recompenseth me, According to my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands, He doth return to me.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, And have not done wickedly against my God.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For all His judgments are before me, As to His statutes, I turn not from them.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And I am perfect before Him, And I keep myself from mine iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And Jehovah returneth to me, According to my righteousness, According to my cleanness before His eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="26">With the kind Thou shewest Thyself kind, With the perfect man Thou shewest Thyself perfect,</verse>
  <verse number="27">With the pure Thou shewest Thyself pure, And with the perverse Thou shewest Thyself a wrestler.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And the poor people Thou dost save, And Thine eyes on the high causest to fall.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For Thou art my lamp, O Jehovah, And Jehovah doth lighten my darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="30">For by Thee I run—a troop, By my God I leap a wall.</verse>
  <verse number="31">God! Perfect is His way, The saying of Jehovah is tried, A shield He is to all those trusting in Him.</verse>
  <verse number="32">For who is God save Jehovah? And who a Rock save our God?</verse>
  <verse number="33">God—my bulwark, my strength, And He maketh perfect my way;</verse>
  <verse number="34">Making my feet like hinds, And on my high places causeth me to stand,</verse>
  <verse number="35">Teaching my hands for battle, And brought down was a bow of brass by mine arms,</verse>
  <verse number="36">And Thou givest to me the shield of Thy salvation, And Thy lowliness maketh me great.</verse>
  <verse number="37">Thou enlargest my step under me, And mine ankles have not slidden.</verse>
  <verse number="38">I pursue mine enemies and destroy them, And I turn not till they are consumed.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And I consume them, and smite them, And they rise not, and fall under my feet.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And Thou girdest me with strength for battle, Thou causest my withstanders to bow under me.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And mine enemies—Thou givest to me the neck, Those hating me—and I cut them off.</verse>
  <verse number="42">They look, and there is no saviour; Unto Jehovah, and He hath not answered them.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And I beat them as dust of the earth, As mire of the streets I beat them small—I spread them out!</verse>
  <verse number="44">And—Thou dost deliver me From the strivings of my people, Thou placest me for a head of nations; A people I have not known do serve me.</verse>
  <verse number="45">Sons of a stranger feign obedience to me, At the hearing of the ear they hearken to me.</verse>
  <verse number="46">Sons of a stranger fade away, And gird themselves by their close places.</verse>
  <verse number="47">Jehovah liveth, and blessed is my Rock, And exalted is my God—The Rock of my salvation.</verse>
  <verse number="48">God—who is giving vengeance to me, And bringing down peoples under me,</verse>
  <verse number="49">And bringing me forth from mine enemies, Yea, above my withstanders Thou raisest me up. From a man of violence Thou deliverest me.</verse>
  <verse number="50">Therefore I confess Thee, O Jehovah, among nations. And to Thy name I sing praise.</verse>
  <verse number="51">Magnifying the salvations of His king, And doing loving-kindness to His anointed, To David, and to his seed—unto the age!’</verse>
