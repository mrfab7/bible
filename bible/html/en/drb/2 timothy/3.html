<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Know also this, that, in the last days, shall come dangerous times.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Men shall be lovers of themselves, covetous, haughty, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, wicked,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Without affection, without peace, slanderers, incontinent, unmerciful, without kindness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Traitors, stubborn, puffed up, and lovers of pleasures more than of God:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Having an appearance indeed of godliness, but denying the power thereof. Now these avoid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For of these sort are they who creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, who are led away with divers desires:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Ever learning, and never attaining to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Now as Jannes and Mambres resisted Moses, so these also resist the truth, men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But they shall proceed no farther; for their folly shall be manifest to all men, as theirs also was.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Persecutions, afflictions: such as came upon me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra: what persecutions I endured, and out of them all the Lord delivered me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And all that will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer persecution.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But evil men and seducers shall grow worse and worse: erring, and driving into error.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But continue thou in those things which thou hast learned, and which have been committed to thee: knowing of whom thou hast learned them;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And because from thy infancy thou hast known the holy scriptures, which can instruct thee to salvation, by the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">All scripture, inspired of God, is profitable to teach, to reprove, to correct, to instruct in justice,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">That the man of God may be perfect, furnished to every good work.</p>
