<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="7" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The life of a man on the earth is a battle, and his days are like the days of a hired hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Just as a servant desires the shade, and just as the hired hand looks forward to the end of his work,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">so also have I had empty months and have counted my burdensome nights.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If I lie down to sleep, I will say, “When will I rise?” And next I will hope for the evening and will be filled with sorrows even until darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">My flesh is clothed with particles of rottenness and filth; my skin is dried up and tightened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">My days have passed by more quickly than threads are cut by a weaver, and they have been consumed without any hope.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Remember that my life is wind, and my eye will not return to see good things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Neither will the sight of man gaze upon me; your eyes are upon me, and I will not endure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Just as a cloud is consumed and passes away, so he who descends to hell will not ascend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He will not return again to his house, nor will his own place know him any longer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And because of this, I will not restrain my mouth. I will speak in the affliction of my spirit. I will converse from the bitterness of my soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Am I an ocean or a whale, that you have encircled me in a prison?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If I say, “My bed will comfort me, and I will find rest, speaking with myself on my blanket,”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">then you will frighten me with dreams, and strike dread through visions,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">so that, because of these things, my soul would choose hanging, and my bones, death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">I despair; by no means will I live any longer. Spare me, for my days are nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">What is man, that you should praise him? Or why do you place your heart near him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">You visit him at dawn, and you test him unexpectedly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">How long will you not spare me, nor release me to ingest my saliva?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">I have sinned; what should I do for you, O keeper of men? Why have you set me against you, so that I have become burdensome even to myself?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Why do you not steal away my sin, and why do you not sweep away my iniquity? Behold, now I will sleep in the dust, and if you seek me in the morning, I will not remain.</p>
