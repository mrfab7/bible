  <verse number="1">And he spoke also a parable to them to the purport that they should always pray and not faint,</verse>
  <verse number="2">saying, There was a judge in a city, not fearing God and not respecting man:</verse>
  <verse number="3">and there was a widow in that city, and she came to him, saying, Avenge me of mine adverse party.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he would not for a time; but afterwards he said within himself, If even I fear not God and respect not man,</verse>
  <verse number="5">at any rate because this widow annoys me I will avenge her, that she may not by perpetually coming completely harass me.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge says.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And shall not God at all avenge his elect, who cry to him day and night, and he bears long as to them?</verse>
  <verse number="8">I say unto you that he will avenge them speedily. But when the Son of man comes, shall he indeed find faith on the earth?</verse>
  <verse number="9">And he spoke also to some, who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and made nothing of all the rest [of men], this parable:</verse>
  <verse number="10">Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a tax-gatherer.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The Pharisee, standing, prayed thus to himself: God, I thank thee that I am not as the rest of men, rapacious, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax-gatherer.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I fast twice in the week, I tithe everything I gain.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the tax-gatherer, standing afar off, would not lift up even his eyes to heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, O God, have compassion on me, the sinner.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I say unto you, This [man] went down to his house justified rather than that [other]. For every one who exalts himself shall be humbled, and he that humbles himself shall be exalted.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And they brought to him also infants that he might touch them, but the disciples when they saw [it] rebuked them.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But Jesus calling them to [him] said, Suffer little children to come to me, and do not forbid them, for of such is the kingdom of God.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Verily I say to you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And a certain ruler asked him saying, Good teacher, having done what, shall I inherit eternal life?</verse>
  <verse number="19">But Jesus said to him, Why callest thou me good? There is none good but one, God.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Thou knowest the commandments: Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And he said, All these things have I kept from my youth.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And when Jesus had heard this, he said to him, One thing is lacking to thee yet: Sell all that thou hast and distribute to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in the heavens, and come, follow me.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But when he heard this he became very sorrowful, for he was very rich.</verse>
  <verse number="24">But when Jesus saw that he became very sorrowful, he said, How difficultly shall those who have riches enter into the kingdom of God;</verse>
  <verse number="25">for it is easier for a camel to enter through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And those who heard it said, And who can be saved?</verse>
  <verse number="27">But he said, The things that are impossible with men are possible with God.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And Peter said, Behold, we have left all things and have followed thee.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And he said to them, Verily I say to you, There is no one who has left home, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God’s sake,</verse>
  <verse number="30">who shall not receive manifold more at this time, and in the coming age life eternal.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And he took the twelve to [him] and said to them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written of the Son of man by the prophets shall be accomplished;</verse>
  <verse number="32">for he shall be delivered up to the nations, and shall be mocked, and insulted, and spit upon.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And when they have scourged [him] they will kill him; and on the third day he will rise again.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And they understood nothing of these things. And this word was hidden from them, and they did not know what was said.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And it came to pass when he came into the neighbourhood of Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the wayside begging.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And when he heard the crowd passing, he inquired what this might be.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And they told him that Jesus the Nazaraean was passing by.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And he called out saying, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And those [who were] going before rebuked him that he might be silent; but he cried out so much the more, Son of David, have mercy on me.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be led to him. And when he drew nigh he asked him [saying],</verse>
  <verse number="41">What wilt thou that I shall do to thee? And he said, Lord, that I may see.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And Jesus said to him, See: thy faith has healed thee.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And immediately he saw, and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people when they saw [it] gave praise to God.</verse>
