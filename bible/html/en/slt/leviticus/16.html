<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Jehovah will say to Moses, Speak to Aaron thy brother, and he shall not come in every time into the holy place within the vail at the face of the cover which is upon the ark; and he shall not die for I will be seen in the cloud upon the cover.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">In this shall Aaron come in to the Holy Place, with a bullock, the son of a cow, for sin, and a ram for a burnt-offering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The holy linen tunic shall be put on, and the linen drawers shall be upon his flesh, and with a linen girdle shall he be girded, and with a linen turban shall he be wound round: these the holy garments; and he washed his flesh in water and put them on.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And from the assembly of the sons of Israel he shall take two he goats of the goats for sin, and one ram for a burnt-offering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Aaron brought near the bullock of sin, which was to him, and he expiated for himself and for his house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And he took the two he goats and made them stand before Jehovah, at the door of the tent of appointment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Aaron gave lots upon the two he goats; one lot for Jehovah, and one lot for the goat set apart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And Aaron brought the he goat which upon it came up the lot for Jehovah, and he did it for the sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the he goat which upon it came up the lot for the goat set apart, shall stand living before Jehovah, to expiate upon him, to send him for a goat set apart to the desert.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And Aaron brought near the bullock of the sin, which was to him, and he expiated for himself, and for his house, and he slaughtered the bullock of the sin which was to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And he took a fire pan full of coals of fire from the altar from before Jehovah, and he filled his hands with incense of aromatics beaten small, and brought within the vail:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And he gave the incense upon the fire before Jehovah, and the cloud of incense covered the vail which was upon the testimonies; and he shall not die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And he took from the blood of the bullock, and sprinkled with his finger upon the face of the cover eastward, and before the cover he shall sprinkle seven times from the blood with his finger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And he slaughtered the he goat of the sin which was for the people, and he brought its blood within the vail, and he did its blood as he did to the blood of the bullocks; and he sprinkled it upon the cover and before the cover.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And he expiated for the holy place from the uncleanness of the sons of Israel, and from their transgression for all their sins: and so shall he do for the tent of appointment, dwelling with them in the midst of their uncleanness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And no man shall be in the tent of appointment in his coming in to expiate in the holy place, till his coming out, he expiated for himself and for his house, and for all the convocation of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And he went forth to the altar which is before Jehovah and expiated upon it; and he took from the blood of the bullock, and from the blood of the he goat, and gave upon the horns of the altar round about.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And he sprinkled upon it from the blood round about with his finger, seven times, and cleansed it, and consecrated it, from the uncleanness of the sons of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And he finished expiating the holy place, and the tent of appointment, and the altar, and he brought the living he goat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Aaron placed his two hands upon the head of the living he goat and confessed over him all the iniquities of the sons of Israel, and all their transgressions, and all their sins, and gave them upon the head of the he goat, and sent by the hand of a fit man to the desert.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And the he goat lifted up upon him all their iniquities to a desert land: and he sent the he goat into the desert.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And Aaron shall come to the tent of appointment, and he put off the garments of linen which he put on in his going in to the holy place, and he left them there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And he washed his flesh in water in the holy place, and he put on his garments and came forth, and did his burnt-offering, and the burnt-offering of the people, and expiated for himself, and for the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And the fat of the sin he shall burn upon the altar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And he sending away the goat set apart, shall wash his garments and wash his flesh in water, and after this he shall go in to the camp.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And the bullock of sin and the he goat of sin, from which he brought their blood to expiate in the holy place, he shall bring forth to without the camp, and they shall burn in fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And he burning them shall wash his clothes and wash his flesh in water, and after this he shall come in to the camp.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And it was to you for a law forever: in the seventh month, in the tenth of the month ye shall humble your souls, and all work ye shall not do, the native and the stranger sojourning in the midst of you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">For in that day he shall expiate for you, to cleanse you from all your sins: before Jehovah shall ye be clean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And this is a Sabbath of Sabbath to you, and ye humbled your souls, a law forever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And the priest expiated whom he shall anoint and whose hand he shall fill, to be priest instead of his father: and he put on the garments of linen of the holy place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And he expiated the holy of holy, and the tent of appointment, and the altar shall he expiate: and for the priests, and for all the people of the convocation, shall he expiate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And this was to you for a law forever to expiate for the sons of Israel, from all their sins once in a year: and he will do as Jehovah commanded Moses.</p>
