<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then drew near to him all the publicans and sinners to hear him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And he spoke this parable to them, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">What man of you having a hundred sheep, if he loseth one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he findeth it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">I say to you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, who need no repentance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she loseth one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she findeth it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her neighbors together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Likewise, I say to you, There is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And he said, A certain man had two sons:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided to them his living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And when he had spent all, there arose a severe famine in that land; and he began to be in want.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat; and no man gave to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father have bread enough and to spare, and I am perishing with hunger!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And he said to him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him in health.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And he was angry, and would not go in; therefore his father came out, and entreated him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And he answering, said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither have I at any time transgressed thy commandment; and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">But as soon as this thy son had come, who hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And he said to him, Son, thou art ever with me: and all that I have is thine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.</p>
