  <verse number="1">BEING justified therefore by faith, let us have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ:</verse>
  <verse number="2">By whom also we have access through faith into this grace, wherein we stand, and glory in the hope of the glory of the sons of God.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And not only so; but we glory also in tribulations, knowing that tribulation worketh patience;</verse>
  <verse number="4">And patience trial; and trial hope;</verse>
  <verse number="5">And hope confoundeth not: because the charity of God is poured forth in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost, who is given to us.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For why did Christ, when as yet we were weak, according to the time, die for the ungodly?</verse>
  <verse number="7">For scarce for a just man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man some one would dare to die.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But God commendeth his charity towards us; because when as yet we were sinners, according to the time,</verse>
  <verse number="9">Christ died for us; much more therefore, being now justified by his blood, shall we be saved from wrath through him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son; much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And not only so; but also we glory in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received reconciliation.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Wherefore as by one man sin entered into this world, and by sin death; and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For until the law sin was in the world; but sin was not imputed, when the law was not.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But death reigned from Adam unto Moses, even over them also who have not sinned after the similitude of the transgression of Adam, who is a figure of him who was to come.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But not as the offence, so also the gift. For if by the offence of one, many died; much more the grace of God, and the gift, by the grace of one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And not as it was by one sin, so also is the gift. For judgment indeed was by one unto condemnation; but grace is of many offences, unto justification.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For if by one man’s offence death reigned through one; much more they who receive abundance of grace, and of the gift, and of justice, shall reign in life through one, Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Therefore, as by the offence of one, unto all men to condemnation; so also by the justice of one, unto all men to justification of life.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For as by the disobedience of one man, many were made sinners; so also by the obedience of one, many shall be made just.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Now the law entered in, that sin might abound. And where sin abounded, grace did more abound.</verse>
  <verse number="21">That as sin hath reigned to death; so also grace might reign by justice unto life everlasting, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
