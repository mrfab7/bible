<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These [are] the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that [are] on the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, [and] cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: [as] the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he [is] unclean unto you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he [is] unclean unto you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he [is] unclean unto you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he [is] unclean to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they [are] unclean to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">These shall ye eat of all that [are] in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which [is] in the waters, they [shall be] an abomination unto you:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that [shall be] an abomination unto you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And these [are they which] ye shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they [are] an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Every raven after his kind;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">All fowls that creep, going upon [all] four, [shall be] an abomination unto you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon [all] four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">[Even] these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">But all [other] flying creeping things, which have four feet, [shall be] an abomination unto you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And whosoever beareth [ought] of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">[The carcases] of every beast which divideth the hoof, and [is] not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, [are] unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that go on [all] four, those [are] unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they [are] unclean unto you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">These also [shall be] unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">These [are] unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And upon whatsoever [any] of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether [it be] any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel [it be], wherein [any] work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And every earthen vessel, whereinto [any] of them falleth, whatsoever [is] in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Of all meat which may be eaten, [that] on which [such] water cometh shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every [such] vessel shall be unclean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And every [thing] whereupon [any part] of their carcase falleth shall be unclean; [whether it be] oven, or ranges for pots, they shall be broken down: [for] they [are] unclean, and shall be unclean unto you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Nevertheless a fountain or pit, [wherein there is] plenty of water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And if [any part] of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it [shall be] clean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">But if [any] water be put upon the seed, and [any part] of their carcase fall thereon, it [shall be] unclean unto you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth [shall be] an abomination; it shall not be eaten.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon [all] four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they [are] an abomination.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">For I [am] the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I [am] holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">For I [am] the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I [am] holy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">This [is] the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.</p>
