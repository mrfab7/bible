<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Job again took up his parable, and said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Oh that I were as in the months of old, As in the days when God watched over me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">When His lamp shined above my head, And by His light I walked through darkness;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">As I was in the days of my youth, When the converse of God was upon my tent;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">When the Almighty was yet with me, And my children were about me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">When my steps were washed with butter, And the rock poured me out rivers of oil!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">When I went forth to the gate unto the city, When I prepared my seat in the broad place,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The young men saw me and hid themselves, And the aged rose up and stood;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The princes refrained talking, And laid their hand on their mouth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The voice of the nobles was hushed, And their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me, And when the eye saw me, it gave witness unto me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Because I delivered the poor that cried, The fatherless also, that had none to help him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me; and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I put on righteousness, and it clothed itself with me; My justice was as a robe and a diadem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I was eyes to the blind, And feet was I to the lame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">I was a father to the needy; And the cause of him that I knew not I searched out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And I broke the jaws of the unrighteous, And plucked the prey out of his teeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Then I said: ‘I shall die with my nest, And I shall multiply my days as the phoenix;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">My root shall be spread out to the waters, And the dew shall lie all night upon my branch;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">My glory shall be fresh in me, And my bow shall be renewed in my hand.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Unto me men gave ear, and waited, And kept silence for my counsel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">After my words they spoke not again; And my speech dropped upon them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And they waited for me as for the rain; And they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">If I laughed on them, they believed it not; And the light of my countenance they cast not down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">I chose out their way, and sat as chief, And dwelt as a king in the army, As one that comforteth the mourners.</p>
