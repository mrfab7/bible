<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, attend to my wisdom, and bow thy ear to my understanding:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For the lips of a strange woman drop as a honey-comb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Lest thou shouldst ponder the path of life, her ways are movable, that thou canst not know them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Lest thou give thy honor to others, and thy years to the cruel:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labors be in the house of a stranger;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined my ear to them that instructed me!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Drink waters out of thy own cistern, and running waters out of thy own well.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Let them be only thy own, and not for strangers with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be held with the cords of his sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.</p>
