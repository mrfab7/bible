  <verse number="1">Hear, ye sons, the instruction of a father, And give attention to know understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For good learning I have given to you, My law forsake not.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For, a son I have been to my father—tender, And an only one before my mother.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he directeth me, and he saith to me: ‘Let thy heart retain my words, Keep my commands, and live.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Get wisdom, get understanding, Do not forget, nor turn away From the sayings of my mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Forsake her not, and she doth preserve thee, Love her, and she doth keep thee.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The first thing is wisdom—get wisdom, And with all thy getting get understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Exalt her, and she doth lift thee up, She honoureth thee, when thou dost embrace her.</verse>
  <verse number="9">She giveth to thy head a wreath of grace, A crown of beauty she doth give thee freely.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Hear, my son, and receive my sayings, And years of life are multiplied to thee.</verse>
  <verse number="11">In a way of wisdom I have directed thee, I have caused thee to tread in paths of uprightness.</verse>
  <verse number="12">In thy walking thy step is not straitened, And if thou runnest, thou stumblest not.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Lay hold on instruction, do not desist, Keep her, for she is thy life.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Into the path of the wicked enter not, And be not happy in a way of evil doers.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Avoid it, pass not over into it, Turn aside from it, and pass on.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For they sleep not if they do not evil, And their sleep hath been taken violently away, If they cause not some to stumble.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For they have eaten bread of wickedness, And wine of violence they drink.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the path of the righteous is as a shining light, Going and brightening till the day is established,</verse>
  <verse number="19">The way of the wicked is as darkness, They have not known at what they stumble.</verse>
  <verse number="20">My son, to my words give attention, To my sayings incline thine ear,</verse>
  <verse number="21">Let them not turn aside from thine eyes, Preserve them in the midst of thy heart.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For life they are to those finding them, And to all their flesh healing.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Above every charge keep thy heart, For out of it are the outgoings of life.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Turn aside from thee a froward mouth, And perverse lips put far from thee,</verse>
  <verse number="25">Thine eyes do look straightforward, And thine eyelids look straight before thee.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Ponder thou the path of thy feet, And all thy ways are established.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Incline not to the right or to the left, Turn aside thy foot from evil!</verse>
