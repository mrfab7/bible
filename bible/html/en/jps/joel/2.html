<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Blow ye the horn in Zion, And sound an alarm in My holy mountain; Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble; For the day of the LORD cometh, For it is at hand;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">A day of darkness and gloominess, A day of clouds and thick darkness, As blackness spread upon the mountains; A great people and a mighty, There hath not been ever the like, Neither shall be any more after them, Even to the years of many generations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A fire devoureth before them, And behind them a flame blazeth; The land is as the garden of Eden before them, And behind them a desolate wilderness; Yea, and nothing escapeth them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; And as horsemen, so do they run.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Like the noise of chariots, On the tops of the mountains do they leap, Like the noise of a flame of fire That devoureth the stubble, As a mighty people set in battle array.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">At their presence the peoples are in anguish; All faces have gathered blackness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">They run like mighty men, They climb the wall like men of war; And they move on every one in his ways, And they entangle not their paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Neither doth one thrust another, They march every one in his highway; And they break through the weapons, And suffer no harm.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">They leap upon the city, They run upon the wall, They climb up into the houses; They enter in at the windows like a thief.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Before them the earth quaketh, The heavens tremble; The sun and the moon are become black, And the stars withdraw their shining.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And the LORD uttereth His voice before His army; For His camp is very great, For he is mighty that executeth His word; For great is the day of the LORD and very terrible; And who can abide it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Yet even now, saith the LORD, Turn ye unto Me with all your heart, And with fasting, and with weeping, and with lamentation;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And rend your heart, and not your garments, And turn unto the LORD your God; For He is gracious and compassionate, long-suffering, and abundant in mercy, And repenteth Him of the evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Who knoweth whether He will not turn and repent, And leave a blessing behind Him, Even a meal-offering and a drink-offering Unto the LORD your God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Blow the horn in Zion, Sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Gather the people, Sanctify the congregation, Assemble the elders, Gather the children, And those that suck the breasts; Let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber, And the bride out of her pavilion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, Weep between the porch and the altar, And let them say: ‘Spare thy people, O LORD, And give not Thy heritage to reproach, That the nations should make them a byword: Wherefore should they say among the peoples: Where is their God?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Then was the LORD jealous for His land, And had pity on His people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And the LORD answered and said unto His people: ‘Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, And ye shall be satisfied therewith; And I will no more make you a reproach among the nations;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But I will remove far off from you the northern one, And will drive him into a land barren and desolate, With his face toward the eastern sea, And his hinder part toward the western sea; That his foulness may come up, and his ill savour may come up, Because he hath done great things.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Fear not, O land, be glad and rejoice; For the LORD hath done great things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field; For the pastures of the wilderness do spring, For the tree beareth its fruit, The fig-tree and the vine do yield their strength.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice In the LORD your God; For He giveth you the former rain in just measure, And He causeth to come down for you the rain, The former rain and the latter rain, at the first.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And the floors shall be full of corn, And the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, The canker-worm, and the caterpiller, and the palmer-worm, My great army which I sent among you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, And shall praise the name of the LORD your God, That hath dealt wondrously with you; And My people shall never be ashamed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, And that I am the LORD your God, and there is none else; And My people shall never be ashamed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And it shall come to pass afterward, That I will pour out My spirit upon all flesh; And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, Your old men shall dream dreams, Your young men shall see visions;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids In those days will I pour out My spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, Blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">The sun shall be turned into darkness, And the moon into blood, Before the great and terrible day of the LORD come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered; For in mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those that escape, As the LORD hath said, And among the remnant those whom the LORD shall call.</p>
