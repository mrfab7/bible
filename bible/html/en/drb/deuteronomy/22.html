<div class="chapter" data-book="Deuteronomy" data-chapter="22" data-translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" data-translation-id="drb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Thou shalt not pass by if thou seest thy brother’s ox, or his sheep go astray: but thou shalt bring them back to thy brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And if thy brother be not nigh, or thou know him not: thou shalt bring them to thy house, and they shall be with thee until thy brother seek them, and receive them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Thou shalt do in like manner with his ass, and with his raiment, and with every thing that is thy brother’s, which is lost: if thou find it, neglect it not as pertaining to another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If thou see thy brother’s ass or his ox to be fallen down in the way, thou shalt not slight it, but shalt lift it up with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">A woman shall not be clothed with man’s apparel, neither shall a man use woman’s apparel : for he that doeth these things is abominable before God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If thou find as thou walkest by the way, a bird’s nest in a tree, or on the ground, and the dam sitting upon the young or upon the eggs: thou shalt not take her with her young:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But shalt let her go, keeping the young which thou hast caught: that it may be well with thee, and thou mayst live a long time.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">When thou buildest a new house, thou shalt make a battlement to the roof round about: lest blood be shed in thy house, and thou be guilty, if any one slip, and fall down headlong.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: lest both the seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of the vineyard, be sanctified together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Thou shalt not plough with an ox and an ass together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Thou shalt not wear a garment that is woven of woollen and linen together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Thou shalt make strings in the hem at the four corners of thy cloak, wherewith thou shalt be covered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If a man marry a wife, and afterwards hate her,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And seek occasions to put her away, laying to her charge a very ill name, and say: I took this woman to wife, and going in to her, I found her not a virgin:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Her father and mother shall take her, and shall bring with them the tokens of her virginity to the ancients of the city that are in the gate:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And the father shall say: I gave my daughter unto this man to wife: and because he hateth her,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He layeth to her charge a very ill name, so as to say: I found not thy daughter a virgin: and behold these are the tokens of my daughter’s virginity. And they shall spread the cloth before the ancients of the city:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And the ancients of that city shall take that man, and beat him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Condemning him besides in a hundred sides of silver, which he shall give to the damsel’s father, because he hath defamed by a very ill name a virgin of Israel: and he shall have her to wife, and may not put her away all the days of his life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But if what he charged her with be true, and virginity be not found in the damsel:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">They shall cast her out of the doors of her father’s house, and the men of the city shall stone her to death, and she shall die: because she hath done a wicked thing in Israel, to play the whore in her father’s house: and thou shalt take away the evil out of the midst of thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">If a man lie with another man’s wife, they shall both die, that is to say, the adulterer and the adulteress: and thou shalt take away the evil out of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">If a man have espoused a damsel that is a virgin, and some one find her in the city, and lie with her,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Thou shalt bring them both out to the gate of that city, and they shall be stoned: the damsel, because she cried not out, being in the city: the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour’s wife. And thou shalt take away the evil from the midst of thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">But if a man find a damsel that is betrothed, in the field, and taking hold of her, lie with her, he alone shall die:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">The damsel shall suffer nothing, neither is she guilty of death : for as a robber riseth against his brother, and taketh away his life, so also did the damsel suffer:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">She was alone in the field: she cried, and there was no man to help her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, who is not espoused, and taking her, lie with her, and the matter come to judgment :</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">He that lay with her shall give to the father of the maid fifty sides of silver, and shall have her to wife, because he hath humbled her: he may not put her away all the days of his life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">No man shall take his father’s wife, nor remove his covering.</p>
