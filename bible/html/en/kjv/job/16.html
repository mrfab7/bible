<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I have heard many such things: miserable comforters [are] ye all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I also could speak as ye [do]: if your soul were in my soulâ€™s stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">[But] I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage [your grief].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and [though] I forbear, what am I eased?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, [which] is a witness [against me]: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He teareth [me] in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken [me] by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids [is] the shadow of death;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Not for [any] injustice in mine hands: also my prayer [is] pure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Also now, behold, my witness [is] in heaven, and my record [is] on high.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">My friends scorn me: [but] mine eye poureth out [tears] unto God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man [pleadeth] for his neighbour!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">When a few years are come, then I shall go the way [whence] I shall not return.</p>
