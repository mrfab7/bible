<chapter book="Acts" number="9" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,</verse>
  <verse number="2">And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me?</verse>
  <verse number="5">And he said, Who are you, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom you persecute: it is hard for you to kick against the pricks.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what will you have me to do? And the Lord said to him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told you what you must do.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the Lord said to him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prays,</verse>
  <verse number="12">And has seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem:</verse>
  <verse number="14">And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on your name.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But the Lord said to him, Go your way: for he is a chosen vessel to me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:</verse>
  <verse number="16">For I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name’s sake.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared to you in the way as you came, has sent me, that you might receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight immediately, and arose, and was baptized.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came here for that intent, that he might bring them bound to the chief priests?</verse>
  <verse number="22">But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelled at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:</verse>
  <verse number="24">But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.</verse>
  <verse number="27">But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared to them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Which when the brothers knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelled at Lydda.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ makes you whole: arise, and make your bed. And he arose immediately.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And all that dwelled at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and giving of alms which she did.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And for as much as Lydda was near to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent to him two men, desiring him that he would not delay to come to them.</verse>
  <verse number="39">Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.</verse>
  <verse number="40">But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.</verse>
