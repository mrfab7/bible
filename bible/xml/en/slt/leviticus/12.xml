  <verse number="1">And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, When a woman shall bear seed and bring forth a male, and she was unclean seven days: according to the days of removal of being sick she shall be unclean.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And in the eighth day the flesh of his uncircumcision shall be circumcised.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And thirty days and three days, she shall sit down in the blood of purification: she shall not touch upon any holy thing, and into the holy place she shall not come till the completing of the days of her purification.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And if she shall bear a female, and she was unclean two sevens, as her removal: and sixty days and six days she shall sit down upon the blood of her purification.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And in completing the days of her purification, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb, the son of his year, for a burnt-offering, and the son of a dove, or a turtle-dove, for the sin, to the door of the tent of appointment, to the priest.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And he offered it before Jehovah, and expiated for her, and cleansed her from the flowing of her blood. This the law of the bringing forth for a male, or for a female.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And if her hand shall not find the sufficiency of a sheep, and she took two turtle-doves or two sons of the dove; one for a burnt-offering, and one for sin: and the priest expiated for her, and she was clean.</verse>
