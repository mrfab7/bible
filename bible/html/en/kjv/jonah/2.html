<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fishâ€™s belly,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, [and] thou heardest my voice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The waters compassed me about, [even] to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars [was] about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay [that] that I have vowed. Salvation [is] of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry [land].</p>
