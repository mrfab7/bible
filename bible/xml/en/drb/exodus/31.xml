  <verse number="1">And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Behold, I have called by name Beseleel the son of Uri the son of Hur of the tribe of Juda,</verse>
  <verse number="3">And I have filled him with the spirit of God, with wisdom and understanding, and knowledge in all manner of work.</verse>
  <verse number="4">To devise whatsoever may be artificially made of gold, and silver, and brass,</verse>
  <verse number="5">Of marble, and precious stones, and variety of wood.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And I have given him for his companion Ooliab the son of Achisamech of the tribe of Dan. And I have put wisdom in the heart of every skilful man, that they may make all things which I have commanded thee,</verse>
  <verse number="7">The tabernacle of the covenant, and the ark of the testimony, and the propitiatory that is over it, and all the vessels of the tabernacle,</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the table and the vessels thereof, the most pure candlestick with the vessels thereof, and the altars of incense,</verse>
  <verse number="9">And of holocaust, and all their vessels, the laver with its foot,</verse>
  <verse number="10">The holy vestments in the ministry for Aaron the priest, and for his sons, that they may execute their office about the sacred things:</verse>
  <verse number="11">The oil of unction, and the incense of spices in the sanctuary, all things which I have commanded thee, shall they make.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="13">Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: See that thou keep my sabbath: because it is a sign between me and you in your generations: that you may know that I am the Lord, who sanctify you.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Keep you my sabbath: for it is holy unto you: he that shall profane it, shall be put to death: he that shall do my work in it, his soul shall perish out of the midst of his people.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Six days shall you do work: in the seventh day is the sabbath, the rest holy to the Lord. Every one that shall do any work on this day, shall die.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Let the children of Israel keep the sabbath, and celebrate it in their generations. It is an everlasting covenant</verse>
  <verse number="17">Between me and the children of Israel, and a perpetual sign. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and in the seventh he ceased from work.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the Lord, when he had ended these words in mount Sinai, gave to Moses two stone tables of testimony, written with the finger of God.</verse>
