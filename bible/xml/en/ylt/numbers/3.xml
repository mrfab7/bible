  <verse number="40">And Jehovah saith unto Moses, ‘Number every first-born male of the sons of Israel from a son of a month and upward, and take up the number of their names;</verse>
  <verse number="41">and thou hast taken the Levites for Me (I am Jehovah), instead of every first-born among the sons of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of every firstling among the cattle of the sons of Israel.’</verse>

  <verse number="45">Take the Levites instead of every first-born among the sons of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites have been Mine; I am Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="46">And from those ransomed of the two hundred and seventy and three (who are more than the Levites) of the first-born of the sons of Israel,</verse>
  <verse number="47">thou hast even taken five shekels a-piece by the poll—by the shekel of the sanctuary thou takest; twenty gerahs the shekel is;</verse>
  <verse number="48">and thou hast given the money to Aaron, and to his sons, whereby those over and above are ransomed.’</verse>
