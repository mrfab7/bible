<chapter book="Isaiah" number="46" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Bel crouches; Nebo cowers. Their idols weigh down beasts and cattle. The images you carry are burdensome, a load to the weary animal.</verse>
  <verse number="2">The gods cower; they crouch together, unable to relieve the burden; but they themselves go into captivity.</verse>
  <verse number="3">“Listen to Me, O house of Jacob, all the remnant of the house of Israel, who have been sustained from the womb, carried along since birth.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Even to your old age, I will be the same, and I will bear you up when you turn gray. I have made you, and I will carry you; I will sustain you and deliver you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">To whom will you liken Me or count Me equal? To whom will you compare Me, that we should be alike?</verse>
  <verse number="6">They pour out their bags of gold and weigh out silver on scales; they hire a goldsmith to fashion it into a god, so they can bow down and worship.</verse>
  <verse number="7">They lift it to their shoulder and carry it along; they set it in its place, and there it stands, not budging from that spot. They cry out to it, but it does not answer; it saves no one from his troubles.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Remember this and be brave; take it to heart, you transgressors!</verse>
  <verse number="9">Remember what happened long ago, for I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like Me.</verse>
  <verse number="10">I declare the end from the beginning, and from ancient times what is still to come. I say, ‘My purpose will stand, and all My good pleasure I will accomplish.’</verse>
  <verse number="11">I summon a bird of prey from the east, a man for My purpose from a far-off land. Truly I have spoken, and truly I will bring it to pass. I have planned it, and I will surely do it.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Listen to Me, you stubborn people, far removed from righteousness:</verse>
  <verse number="13">I am bringing My righteousness near; it is not far away, and My salvation will not be delayed. I will grant salvation to Zion and adorn Israel with My splendor.</verse>
