<p class="verse" data-verse="1">As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Jesus answered, “Neither did this man sin, nor his parents; but, that the works of God might be revealed in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day. The night is coming, when no one can work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">When he had said this, he spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind man’s eyes with the mud,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">and said to him, “Go, wash in the pool of Siloam” (which means “Sent”). So he went away, washed, and came back seeing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The neighbors therefore, and those who saw that he was blind before, said, “Isn’t this he who sat and begged?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Others were saying, “It is he.” Still others were saying, “He looks like him.” He said, “I am he.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">They therefore were asking him, “How were your eyes opened?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He answered, “A man called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me, ‘Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash.’ So I went away and washed, and I received sight.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Then they asked him, “Where is he?” He said, “I don’t know.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">It was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. He said to them, “He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and I see.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Some therefore of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, because he doesn’t keep the Sabbath.” Others said, “How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?” There was division among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Therefore they asked the blind man again, “What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes?” He said, “He is a prophet.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">and asked them, “Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">His parents answered them, “We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">but how he now sees, we don’t know; or who opened his eyes, we don’t know. He is of age. Ask him. He will speak for himself.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">His parents said these things because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Therefore his parents said, “He is of age. Ask him.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">So they called the man who was blind a second time, and said to him, “Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">He therefore answered, “I don’t know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: that though I was blind, now I see.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">They said to him again, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He answered them, “I told you already, and you didn’t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You don’t also want to become his disciples, do you?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">They insulted him and said, “You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">We know that God has spoken to Moses. But as for this man, we don’t know where he comes from.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">The man answered them, “How amazing! You don’t know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">We know that God doesn’t listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshipper of God, and does his will, he listens to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Since the world began it has never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">They answered him, “You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us?” They threw him out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him, he said, “Do you believe in the Son of God?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">He answered, “Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">Jesus said to him, “You have both seen him, and it is he who speaks with you.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">He said, “Lord, I believe!” and he worshiped him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Jesus said, “I came into this world for judgment, that those who don’t see may see; and that those who see may become blind.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said to him, “Are we also blind?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Jesus said to them, “If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, ‘We see.’ Therefore your sin remains.</p>
