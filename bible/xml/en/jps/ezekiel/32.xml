  <verse number="1">And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him: Thou didst liken thyself unto a young lion of the nations; Whereas thou art as a dragon in the seas; And thou didst gush forth with thy rivers, And didst trouble the waters with thy feet, And foul their rivers.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Thus saith the Lord GOD: I will therefore spread out My net over thee With a company of many peoples; And they shall bring thee up in My net.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And I will cast thee upon the land, I will hurl thee upon the open field, And will cause all the fowls of the heaven to settle upon thee, And I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, And fill the valleys with thy foulness.</verse>
  <verse number="6">I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest, even to the mountains; And the channels shall be full of thee.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And when I shall extinguish thee, I will cover the heaven, And make the stars thereof black; I will cover the sun with a cloud, And the moon shall not give her light.</verse>
  <verse number="8">All the bright lights of heaven Will I make black over thee, And set darkness upon thy land, Saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
  <verse number="9">I will also vex the hearts of many peoples, when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast not known.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Yea, I will make many peoples appalled at thee, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish My sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For thus saith the Lord GOD: The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee.</verse>
  <verse number="12">By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall; The terrible of the nations are they all; And they shall spoil the pride of Egypt, And all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed.</verse>
  <verse number="13">I will destroy also all the beasts thereof From beside many waters; Neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, Nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Then will I make their waters to settle, And cause their rivers to run like oil, Saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
  <verse number="15">When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate and waste, A land destitute of that whereof it was full, When I shall smite all them that dwell therein, Then shall they know that I am the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="16">This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament; The daughters of the nations shall lament therewith; For Egypt, and for all her multitude, shall they lament therewith, Saith the Lord GOD.’</verse>
  <verse number="17">It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="18">Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her, with the daughters of the mighty nations, unto the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Whom dost thou pass in beauty? Go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised.</verse>
  <verse number="20">They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword; she is delivered to the sword; draw her down and all her multitudes.</verse>
  <verse number="21">The strong among the mighty shall speak of him out of the midst of the nether-world with them that helped him; they are gone down, they lie still, even the uncircumcised, slain by the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Asshur is there and all her company; their graves are round about them; all of them slain, fallen by the sword;</verse>
  <verse number="23">whose graves are set in the uttermost parts of the pit, and her company is round about her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who caused terror in the land of the living.</verse>
  <verse number="24">There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, who caused their terror in the land of the living; yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit.</verse>
  <verse number="25">They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude; her graves are round about them; all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; because their terror was caused in the land of the living, yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit; they are put in the midst of them that are slain.</verse>
  <verse number="26">There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude; her graves are round about them; all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; because they caused their terror in the land of the living.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And they that are inferior to the uncircumcised shall not lie with the mighty that are gone down to the nether-world with their weapons of war, whose swords are laid under their heads, and whose iniquities are upon their bones; because the terror of the mighty was in the land of the living.</verse>
  <verse number="28">But thou, in the midst of the uncircumcised shalt thou be broken and lie, even with them that are slain by the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="29">There is Edom, her kings and all her princes, who for all their might are laid with them that are slain by the sword; they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with them that go down to the pit.</verse>
  <verse number="30">There are the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Zidonians, who are gone down with the slain, ashamed for all the terror which they caused by their might, and they lie uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword, and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit.</verse>
  <verse number="31">These shall Pharaoh see, and shall be comforted over all his multitude; even Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
  <verse number="32">For I have put My terror in the land of the living; and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them that are slain by the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord GOD.’</verse>
