<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I say [the] truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing witness with me in [the] Holy Spirit,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">that I have great grief and uninterrupted pain in my heart,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">for I have wished, I myself, to be a curse from the Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen, according to flesh;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">who are Israelites; whose [is] the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the law-giving, and the service, and the promises;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">whose [are] the fathers; and of whom, as according to flesh, [is] the Christ, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Not however as though the word of God had failed; for not all [are] Israel which [are] of Israel;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">nor because they are seed of Abraham [are] all children: but, In Isaac shall a seed be called to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">That is, [they that are] the children of the flesh, these [are] not the children of God; but the children of the promise are reckoned as seed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For this word [is] of promise, According to this time I will come, and there shall be a son to Sarah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And not only [that], but Rebecca having conceived by one, Isaac our father,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">[the children] indeed being not yet born, or having done anything good or worthless (that the purpose of God according to election might abide, not of works, but of him that calls),</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">it was said to her, The greater shall serve the less:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">according as it is written, I have loved Jacob, and I have hated Esau.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">What shall we say then? [Is there] unrighteousness with God? Far be the thought.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For he says to Moses, I will shew mercy to whom I will shew mercy, and I will feel compassion for whom I will feel compassion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">So then [it is] not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that shews mercy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For the scripture says to Pharaoh, For this very thing I have raised thee up from amongst [men], that I might thus shew in thee my power, and so that my name should be declared in all the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">So then, to whom he will he shews mercy, and whom he will he hardens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Thou wilt say to me then, Why does he yet find fault? for who resists his purpose?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Aye, but thou, O man, who art thou that answerest again to God? Shall the thing formed say to him that has formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Or has not the potter authority over the clay, out of the same lump to make one vessel to honour, and another to dishonour?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And if God, minded to shew his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering vessels of wrath fitted for destruction;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">and that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he had before prepared for glory,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">us, whom he has also called, not only from amongst [the] Jews, but also from amongst [the] nations?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">As he says also in Hosea, I will call not-my-people My people; and the-not-beloved Beloved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And it shall be, in the place where it was said to them, Ye [are] not my people, there shall they be called Sons of [the] living God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">But Esaias cries concerning Israel, Should the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">for [he] is bringing the matter to an end, and [cutting [it] short in righteousness; because] a cutting short of the matter will [the] Lord accomplish upon the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And according as Esaias said before, Unless [the] Lord of hosts had left us a seed, we had been as Sodom, and made like even as Gomorrha.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">What then shall we say? That [they of the] nations, who did not follow after righteousness, have attained righteousness, but [the] righteousness that is on the principle of faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">But Israel, pursuing after a law of righteousness, has not attained to [that] law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Wherefore? Because [it was] not on the principle of faith, but as of works. They have stumbled at the stumblingstone,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">according as it is written, Behold, I place in Zion a stone of stumbling and rock of offence: and he that believes on him shall not be ashamed.</p>
