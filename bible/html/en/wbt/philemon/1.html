<div class="chapter" data-book="Philemon" data-chapter="1" data-translation="Webster Bible Translation" data-translation-id="wbt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellow-laborer,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the church in thy house:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast towards the Lord Jesus, and towards all saints;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Wherefore, though I might be very bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Yet for loveâ€™s sake I rather beseech thee, being such one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Who in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, my own bowels:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered to me in the bonds of the gospel:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But without thy mind I would do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldst receive him for ever;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more to thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">If thou accountest me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee aught, put that on my account;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">I Paul have written it with my own hand, I will repay it: although I do not say to thee that thou owest to me even thy own self besides.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Yes, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote to thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But at the same time prepare me also a lodging; for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">There salute thee Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellow-laborers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</p>
