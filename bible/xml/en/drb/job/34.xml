<chapter book="Job" number="34" translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" translationID="drb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And Eliu continued his discourse, and said :</verse>
  <verse number="2">Hear ye, wise men, my words, and ye learned, hearken to me :</verse>
  <verse number="3">For the ear trieth words, and the mouth discerneth meats by the taste.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Let us choose to us judgment, and let us see among ourselves what is the best.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For Job hath said : I am just, and God hath overthrown my judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For in judging me there is a lie : my arrow is violent without any sin.</verse>
  <verse number="7">What man is there like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Who goeth in company with them that work iniquity, and walketh with wicked men?</verse>
  <verse number="9">For he hath said : Man shall not please God, although he run with him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Therefore, ye men of understanding, hear me : far from god be wickedness, and iniquity from the Almighty.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For he will render to a man his work, and according to the ways of every one he will reward them.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For in very deed God will not condemn without cause, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="13">What other hath he appointed over the earth? or whom hath he set over the world which he made?</verse>
  <verse number="14">If he turn his heart to him, he shall draw his spirit and breath unto himself.</verse>
  <verse number="15">All flesh shall perish together, and man shall return into ashes.</verse>
  <verse number="16">If then thou hast understanding, hear what is said, and hearken to the voice of my words.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Can he be healed that loveth not judgment? and how dost thou so far condemn him that is just?</verse>
  <verse number="18">Who saith to the king : Thou art an apostate : who calleth rulers ungodly?</verse>
  <verse number="19">Who accepteth not the persons of princes : nor hath regarded the tyrant, when he contended against the poor man : for all are the work of his hands.</verse>
  <verse number="20">They shall suddenly die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and they shall pass, and take away the violent without hand.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For his eyes are upon the ways of men, and he considereth all their steps.</verse>
  <verse number="22">There is no darkness, and there is no shadow of death, where they may be hid who work iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For it is no longer in the power of man to enter into judgment with God.</verse>
  <verse number="24">He shall break in pieces many and innumerable, and shall make others to stand in their stead.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For he knoweth their works : and therefore he shall bring night on them, and they shall be destroyed.</verse>
  <verse number="26">He hath struck them, as being wicked, in open sight.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Who as it were on purpose have revolted from him, and would not understand all his ways :</verse>
  <verse number="28">So that they caused the cry of the needy to come to him, and he heard the voice of the poor.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For when he granteth peace, who is there that can condemn? When he hideth his countenance, who is there that can behold him, whether it regard nations, or all men?</verse>
  <verse number="30">Who maketh a man that is a hypocrite to reign for the sins of the people?</verse>
  <verse number="31">Seeing then I have spoken of God, I will not hinder thee in thy turn.</verse>
  <verse number="32">If I have erred, teach thou me : if I have spoken iniquity, I will add no more.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Doth God require it of thee, because it hath displeased thee? for thou begannest to speak, and not I. : but if thou know any thing better, speak.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Let men of understanding speak to me, and let a wise man hearken to me.</verse>
  <verse number="35">But Job hath spoken foolishly, and his words sound not discipline.</verse>
  <verse number="36">My father, let Job be tried even to the end : cease not from the man of iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="37">Because he addeth blasphemy upon his sins, let him be tied fast in the mean time amongst us : and then let him provoke God to judgment with his speeches.</verse>
