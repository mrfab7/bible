<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="33" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">“But now, O Job, hear my speech, and listen to all my words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Behold, I will open my mouth; my address is on the tip of my tongue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">My words are from an upright heart, and my lips speak sincerely what I know.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Refute me if you can; prepare your case and confront me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I am just like you before God; I was also formed from clay.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Surely no fear of me should terrify you; nor will my hand be heavy upon you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Surely you have spoken in my hearing, and I have heard these very words:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">‘I am pure, without transgression; I am clean, with no iniquity in me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Yet God finds occasions against me; He counts me as His enemy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He puts my feet in the stocks; He watches over all my paths.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Behold, you are not right in this matter. I will answer you, for God is greater than man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Why do you complain to Him that He answers nothing a man asks?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For God speaks in one way and in another, yet no one notices.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">In a dream, in a vision in the night, when deep sleep falls upon men as they slumber on their beds,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He opens their ears and terrifies them with warnings</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">to turn a man from wrongdoing and keep him from pride,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">to preserve his soul from the Pit and his life from perishing by the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">A man is also chastened on his bed with pain and constant distress in his bones,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">so that he detests his bread, and his soul loathes his favorite food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">His flesh wastes away from sight, and his hidden bones protrude.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He draws near to the Pit, and his life to the messengers of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Yet if there is a messenger on his side, one mediator in a thousand, to tell a man what is right for him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">to be gracious to him and say, ‘Spare him from going down to the Pit; I have found his ransom,’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">then his flesh is refreshed like a child’s; he returns to the days of his youth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He prays to God and finds favor; he sees God’s face and shouts for joy, and God restores His righteousness to that man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Then he sings before men with these words: ‘I have sinned and perverted what was right; yet I did not get what I deserved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">He redeemed my soul from going down to the Pit, and I will live to see the light.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Behold, all these things God does to a man, two or even three times,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">to bring back his soul from the Pit, that he may be enlightened with the light of life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Pay attention, Job, and listen to me; be silent, and I will speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">But if you have something to say, answer me; speak up, for I would like to vindicate you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">But if not, then listen to me; be quiet, and I will teach you wisdom.”</p>
