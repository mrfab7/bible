<chapter book="Philemon" number="1" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellow laborer,</verse>
  <verse number="2">And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:</verse>
  <verse number="3">Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I thank my God, making mention of you always in my prayers,</verse>
  <verse number="5">Hearing of your love and faith, which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;</verse>
  <verse number="6">That the communication of your faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For we have great joy and consolation in your love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by you, brother.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Why, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin you that which is convenient,</verse>
  <verse number="9">Yet for love’s sake I rather beseech you, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="10">I beseech you for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</verse>
  <verse number="11">Which in time past was to you unprofitable, but now profitable to you and to me:</verse>
  <verse number="12">Whom I have sent again: you therefore receive him, that is, my own bowels:</verse>
  <verse number="13">Whom I would have retained with me, that in your stead he might have ministered to me in the bonds of the gospel:</verse>
  <verse number="14">But without your mind would I do nothing; that your benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that you should receive him for ever;</verse>
  <verse number="16">Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</verse>
  <verse number="17">If you count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</verse>
  <verse number="18">If he has wronged you, or owes you ought, put that on my account;</verse>
  <verse number="19">I Paul have written it with my own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to you how you owe to me even your own self besides.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Yes, brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Having confidence in your obedience I wrote to you, knowing that you will also do more than I say.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But with prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given to you.</verse>
  <verse number="23">There salute you Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus;</verse>
  <verse number="24">Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellow laborers.</verse>
  <verse number="25">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</verse>
