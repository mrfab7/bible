<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was approaching,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and the chief priests and scribes were looking for a way to put Jesus to death, for they feared the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Then Satan entered Judas Iscariot, who was one of the Twelve.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And Judas went to discuss with the chief priests and temple officers how he might betray Jesus to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">They were delighted and agreed to give him money.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Judas consented, and began to look for an opportunity to betray Jesus to them in the absence of a crowd.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb was to be sacrificed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">“Where do You want us to prepare it?” they asked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He answered, “When you enter the city, a man carrying a jug of water will meet you. Follow him to the house he enters,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">and say to the owner of that house, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with My disciples?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And he will show you a large upper room, already furnished. Make preparations there.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">So they went and found it just as Jesus had told them. And they prepared the Passover.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">When the hour had come, Jesus reclined at the table with His apostles.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And He said to them, “I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before My suffering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For I tell you that I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">After taking the cup, He gave thanks and said, “Take this and divide it among yourselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For I tell you that I will not drink of the fruit of the vine from now on until the kingdom of God comes.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And He took the bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, “This is My body, given for you; do this in remembrance of Me.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">In the same way, after supper He took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is poured out for you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Look! The hand of My betrayer is with Mine on the table.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Indeed, the Son of Man will go as it has been determined, but woe to that man who betrays Him.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Then they began to question among themselves which of them was going to do this.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">A dispute also arose among the disciples as to which of them should be considered the greatest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">So Jesus declared, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those in authority over them call themselves benefactors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">But you shall not be like them. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who leads like the one who serves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For who is greater, the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines? But I am among you as one who serves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">You are the ones who have stood by Me in My trials.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And I bestow on you a kingdom, just as My Father has bestowed one on Me,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">so that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift all of you like wheat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith will not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">“Lord,” said Peter, “I am ready to go with You even to prison and to death.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">But Jesus replied, “I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know Me.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Then Jesus asked them, “When I sent you out without purse or bag or sandals, did you lack anything?” “Nothing,” they answered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">“Now, however,” He told them, “the one with a purse should take it, and likewise a bag; and the one without a sword should sell his cloak and buy one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in Me: ‘And He was numbered with the transgressors.’ For what is written about Me is reaching its fulfillment.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">So they said, “Look, Lord, here are two swords.” “That is enough,” He answered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">When He came to the place, He told them, “Pray that you will not enter into temptation.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">And He withdrew about a stone’s throw beyond them, where He knelt down and prayed,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">“Father, if You are willing, take this cup from Me. Yet not My will, but Yours be done.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">Then an angel from heaven appeared to Him and strengthened Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">And in His anguish, He prayed more earnestly, and His sweat became like drops of blood falling to the ground.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">When Jesus rose from prayer and returned to the disciples, He found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">“Why are you sleeping?” He asked. “Get up and pray so that you will not enter into temptation.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">While He was still speaking, a crowd arrived, led by the man called Judas, one of the Twelve. He approached Jesus to kiss Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">But Jesus asked him, “Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">Those around Jesus saw what was about to happen and said, “Lord, should we strike with our swords?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">But Jesus answered, “No more of this!” And He touched the man’s ear and healed him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="52">Then Jesus said to the chief priests, temple officers, and elders who had come for Him, “Have you come out with swords and clubs as you would against an outlaw?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on Me. But this hour belongs to you and to the power of darkness.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="54">Then they seized Jesus, led Him away, and took Him into the house of the high priest. And Peter followed at a distance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="55">When those present had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="56">A servant girl saw him seated in the firelight and looked intently at him. “This man also was with Him,” she said.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="57">But Peter denied it. “Woman, I do not know Him,” he said.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="58">A short time later, someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them.” But Peter said, “Man, I am not.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="59">About an hour later, another man insisted, “Certainly this man was with Him, for he too is a Galilean.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="60">“Man, I do not know what you are talking about,” Peter replied. And immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="61">And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word that the Lord had spoken to him: “Before the rooster crows today, you will deny Me three times.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="62">And he went outside and wept bitterly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="63">The men who were holding Jesus began to mock Him and beat Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="64">They blindfolded Him and kept demanding, “Prophesy! Who hit You?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="65">And they said many other blasphemous things against Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="66">At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and scribes, met together. They led Jesus into their Sanhedrin and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="67">“If You are the Christ, tell us.” Jesus answered, “If I tell you, you will not believe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="68">And if I ask you a question, you will not answer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="69">But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="70">So they all asked, “Are You then the Son of God?” He replied, “You say that I am.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="71">“Why do we need any more testimony?” they declared. “We have heard it for ourselves from His own lips.”</p>
