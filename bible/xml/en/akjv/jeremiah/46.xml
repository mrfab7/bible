  <verse number="3">Order you the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Harness the horses; and get up, you horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets; furbish the spears, and put on the brigandines.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Why have I seen them dismayed and turned away back? and their mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and look not back: for fear was round about, said the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they shall stumble, and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Who is this that comes up as a flood, whose waters are moved as the rivers?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Egypt rises up like a flood, and his waters are moved like the rivers; and he said, I will go up, and will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Come up, you horses; and rage, you chariots; and let the mighty men come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the shield; and the Lydians, that handle and bend the bow.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall devour, and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood: for the Lord GOD of hosts has a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt: in vain shall you use many medicines; for you shall not be cured.</verse>
  <verse number="12">The nations have heard of your shame, and your cry has filled the land: for the mighty man has stumbled against the mighty, and they are fallen both together.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The word that the LORD spoke to Jeremiah the prophet, how Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Declare you in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph and in Tahpanhes: say you, Stand fast, and prepare you; for the sword shall devour round about you.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Why are your valiant men swept away? they stood not, because the LORD did drive them.</verse>
  <verse number="16">He made many to fall, yes, one fell on another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword.</verse>
  <verse number="17">They did cry there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he has passed the time appointed.</verse>
  <verse number="18">As I live, said the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts, Surely as Tabor is among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, so shall he come.</verse>
  <verse number="19">O you daughter dwelling in Egypt, furnish yourself to go into captivity: for Noph shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Egypt is like a very fair heifer, but destruction comes; it comes out of the north.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Also her hired men are in the middle of her like fatted bullocks; for they also are turned back, and are fled away together: they did not stand, because the day of their calamity was come on them, and the time of their visitation.</verse>
  <verse number="22">The voice thereof shall go like a serpent; for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood.</verse>
  <verse number="23">They shall cut down her forest, said the LORD, though it cannot be searched; because they are more than the grasshoppers, and are innumerable.</verse>
  <verse number="24">The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north.</verse>
  <verse number="25">The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, said; Behold, I will punish the multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods, and their kings; even Pharaoh, and all them that trust in him:</verse>
  <verse number="26">And I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants: and afterward it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, said the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="27">But fear not you, O my servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O Israel: for, behold, I will save you from afar off, and your seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and be in rest and at ease, and none shall make him afraid.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Fear you not, O Jacob my servant, said the LORD: for I am with you; for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have driven you: but I will not make a full end of you, but correct you in measure; yet will I not leave you wholly unpunished.</verse>
