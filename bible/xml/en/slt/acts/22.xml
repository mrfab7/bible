  <verse number="1">Men, brethren, and fathers, hear my defence to you.</verse>
  <verse number="2">(And having heard that he spake to them in Hebrew dialect, they held more silence: and he says,)</verse>
  <verse number="3">I am truly a Jew, a man born in Tarsus, of Cilicia, and brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, instructed according to the exactness of the fathers’ law, being zealous of God, as all ye are this day.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Who drove out this way even to death, binding and delivering to prison both men and women.</verse>
  <verse number="5">As also the chief priest testifies of me, and all the council of elders: and whose letters to the brethren having received, I went to Damascus, going to bring there the bound to Jerusalem, that they might be punished.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And it was to me going, and drawing near to Damascus about noon, suddenly much light from heaven flashed around me,</verse>
  <verse number="7">And I fell to the ground, and heard a voice, Saul, Saul, why drivest thou me out?</verse>
  <verse number="8">And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus the Nazarite, whom thou drivest out.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And they being with me truly saw the light, and were terrified; but they heard not the voice of him speaking to me.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Having risen, go to Damascus; and there shall be told thee of all which has been arranged for thee to do.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And when I saw not from the glory of that light, led by the hand of them being with me I came to Damascus.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And a certain Ananias, a religious man according to the law, testified of by all the Jews dwelling,</verse>
  <verse number="13">Having come to me, and stood, said to me, Brother Saul, look up. And the same hour I looked up to him.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And he said, The God of our fathers took thee in hand, to know his will, and to see the Just, and hear the voice from his mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For thou shalt be a witness for him to all men of what thou hast seen and hast heard.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And now what art thou about to do having risen, be immersed and wash away thy sins, having called upon the name of the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And it was to me returning to Jerusalem, and praying in the temple, I was in a deep trance:</verse>
  <verse number="18">And saw him saying to me, Hasten, and come quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony of me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And I said, Lord, these know that I was imprisoning and skinning in the synagogues them believing on thee:</verse>
  <verse number="20">And when the blood of Stephen thy witness was shed, I myself was standing by, and assenting to his murder, and watching the garments of them murdering him.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And he said to me, Go: for I will send thee far off to the nations.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And they heard him to this word, and lifted up their voices, saying, Take away such a one from the earth: for it is not suitable for him to live.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And they vociferating, and casting garments away, and throwing a cloud of dust into the air,</verse>
  <verse number="24">The captain of a thousand commanded him to be brought to the camp, having spoken to examine him by scourges; that he might know for what cause they exclaimed so against him.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And as he held him before with thongs, Paul said to the centurion standing by, Is it lawful to scourge a man a Roman, and uncondemned?</verse>
  <verse number="26">And the centurion having heard, having come near announced to the captain of a thousand, See what thou art about to do: for this man is a Roman.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And the captain of a thousand having come near, said to him, Tell me if thou art a Roman. And he said, Yes.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And the captain of a thousand answered, I obtained this citizenship for much capital. And Paul said, And I have been born.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Then quickly they about to examine him withdrew from him: and the captain of a thousand was afraid, knowing that he is a Roman, and because he had bound him.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And on the morrow, wishing to know the certainty that why he was accused by the Jews, he loosed him from bonds, and commanded the chief priests and the whole of their council to come, and having brought down Paul, he set him among them.</verse>
