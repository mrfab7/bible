<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And of the times and seasons, brethren, ye have no need to write to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For ye yourselves know accurately that the day of the Lord, as a thief in the night, so comes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For when they say, Peace and security; then sudden ruin is upon them, as anguish in her with child; and they may not escape.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day as a thief overtake you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Ye are all sons of light, and sons of day: we are not of night, nor of darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Therefore let us not sleep, as also the rest; but let us watch and be sober.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For they sleeping sleep in the night; and they drunken are drunken in the night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And we, being of the day, let us be sober, putting on the coat of mail of faith and love; and a helmet, the hope of salvation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For God set us not for wrath, but for the acquisition of salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He having died for us, that, whether we watch or sleep, we should live together with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Wherefore comfort one another, and build up one another, as also ye do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And we ask you, brethren, to know those being fatigued among you, and set over you in the Lord, and reminding you;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And to think them above ordinary in love for their work. Live in peace in yourselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And we beseech you, brethren, remind the disorderly, encourage the timid, sustain the weak, and be slow to anger to all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">See that any return not evil to any: but always pursue good to one another, and to all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Rejoice always.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Pray continually.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">In every thing return thanks: for this the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Quench not the Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Set not prophecies at nought.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Try all things; hold the good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Keep away from all appearance of evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And the same God of peace consecrate you perfectly compete; and your whole spirit and soul and body be kept faultless to the arrival of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Faithful he calling you, who also will do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Brethren, pray for us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Greet all the brethren in a holy kiss.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">I bind you by oath, for the epistle to be read to all the holy brethren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with you. Amen.</p>
