<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And this know, that in the last days difficult times shall interpose.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For men shall be self-lovers, lovers of money, boastful, proud, slandering, disobedient to parents, unthankful, wicked,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Devoid of natural affection, not observing treaties, accusers, ungoverned, wild, not loving the good,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Traitors, rash, haughty, devoted to pleasure more than loving God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Having a form of devotion, and having denied its power: and these renounce.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For of these are they going into houses, and taking captive little women heaped up with sins, led away with various eager desires,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so also these have withstood the truth: men corrupted in mind, not tried concerning the faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest to all, as theirs also was.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And thou hast closely followed my doctrine, mode of life, purpose, faith, long suffering, love, patience,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Expulsions, sufferings, which were to me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; what expulsions I endured: and the Lord delivered me from all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And all wishing to live devotedly in Christ Jesus shall be driven out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And evil men and impostors shall proceed to worse, deceiving, and being deceived.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And remain thou in what things thou hast learned and hast been convinced of, knowing of whom thou hast learned;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And that from infancy thou hast known the holy letters, able to render thee wise to salvation by faith which in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">All writing divinely inspired, and profitable for doctrine, for refutation, for correction, for instruction in justice:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">That the man of God might be perfect, finished for every good work.</p>
