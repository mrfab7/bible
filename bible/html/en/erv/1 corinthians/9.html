<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Corinthians" data-chapter="9" data-translation="English Revised Version" data-translation-id="erv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Am I not free? am I not an apostle? have I not seen Jesus our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">If to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you; for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">My defence to them that examine me is this.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Have we no right to eat and to drink?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Have we no right to lead about a wife that is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Or I only and Barnabas, have we not a right to forbear working?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">What soldier ever serveth at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Do I speak these things after the manner of men? or saith not the law also the same?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. Is it for the oxen that God careth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">or saith he it altogether for our sake? Yea, for our sake it was written: because he that ploweth ought to plow in hope, and he that thresheth, to thresh in hope of partaking.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">If we sowed unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we shall reap your carnal things?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">If others partake of this right over you, do not we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right; but we bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Know ye not that they which minister about sacred things eat of the things of the temple, and they which wait upon the altar have their portion with the altar?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Even so did the Lord ordain that they which proclaim the gospel should live of the gospel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But I have used none of these things: and I write not these things that it may be so done in my case: for it were good for me rather to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of; for necessity is laid upon me; for woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For if I do this of mine own will, I have a reward: but if not of mine own will, I have a stewardship intrusted to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">What then is my reward? That, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel without charge, so as not to use to the full my right in the gospel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For though I was free from all men, I brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, not being myself under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">to them that are without law, as without law, not being without law to God, but under law to Christ, that I might gain them that are without law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak: I am become all things to all men, that I may by all means save some.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And I do all things for the gospelâ€™s sake, that I may be a joint partaker thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? Even so run, that ye may attain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And every man that striveth in the games is temperate in all things. Now they do it to receive a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">I therefore so run, as not uncertainly; so fight I, as not beating the air:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">but I buffet my body, and bring it into bondage: lest by any means, after that I have preached to others, I myself should be rejected.</p>
