  <verse number="1">The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel:</verse>
  <verse number="2">To know wisdom and instruction; to discern the words of understanding;</verse>
  <verse number="3">To receive instruction in wise dealing, in righteousness and judgment and equity;</verse>
  <verse number="4">To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion:</verse>
  <verse number="5">That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning; and that the man of understanding may attain unto sound counsels:</verse>
  <verse number="6">To understand a proverb, and a figure; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.</verse>
  <verse number="8">My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</verse>
  <verse number="9">For they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.</verse>
  <verse number="10">My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.</verse>
  <verse number="11">If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause;</verse>
  <verse number="12">Let us swallow them up alive as Sheol, and whole, as those that go down into the pit;</verse>
  <verse number="13">We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil;</verse>
  <verse number="14">Thou shalt cast thy lot among us; we will all have one purse:</verse>
  <verse number="15">My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:</verse>
  <verse number="16">For their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For in vain is the net spread, in the eyes of any bird:</verse>
  <verse number="18">And these lay wait for their own blood, they lurk privily for their own lives.</verse>
  <verse number="19">So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; it taketh away the life of the owners thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Wisdom crieth aloud in the street; she uttereth her voice in the broad places;</verse>
  <verse number="21">She crieth in the chief place of concourse; at the entering in of the gates, in the city, she uttereth her words:</verse>
  <verse number="22">How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and scorners delight them in scorning, and fools hate knowledge?</verse>
  <verse number="23">Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;</verse>
  <verse number="25">But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:</verse>
  <verse number="26">I also will laugh in the day of your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;</verse>
  <verse number="27">When your fear cometh as a storm, and your calamity cometh on as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish come upon you.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me diligently, but they shall not find me:</verse>
  <verse number="29">For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:</verse>
  <verse number="30">They would none of my counsel; they despised all my reproof:</verse>
  <verse number="31">Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</verse>
  <verse number="32">For the backsliding of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.</verse>
  <verse number="33">But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell securely, and shall be quiet without fear of evil.</verse>
