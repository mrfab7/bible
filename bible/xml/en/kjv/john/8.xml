  <verse number="1">Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,</verse>
  <verse number="4">They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?</verse>
  <verse number="6">This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with [his] finger wrote on the ground, [as though he heard them not].</verse>
  <verse number="7">So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And they which heard [it], being convicted by [their own] conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, [even] unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</verse>
  <verse number="10">When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</verse>
  <verse number="11">She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, [yet] my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="17">It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.</verse>
  <verse number="18">I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.</verse>
  <verse number="20">These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.</verse>
  <verse number="24">I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am [he], ye shall die in your sins.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even [the same] that I said unto you from the beginning.</verse>
  <verse number="26">I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.</verse>
  <verse number="27">They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am [he], and [that] I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.</verse>
  <verse number="30">As he spake these words, many believed on him.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, [then] are ye my disciples indeed;</verse>
  <verse number="32">And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</verse>
  <verse number="33">They answered him, We be Abraham’s seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?</verse>
  <verse number="34">Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: [but] the Son abideth ever.</verse>
  <verse number="36">If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.</verse>
  <verse number="37">I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.</verse>
  <verse number="38">I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.</verse>
  <verse number="39">They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham.</verse>
  <verse number="40">But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.</verse>
  <verse number="41">Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, [even] God.</verse>
  <verse number="42">Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="43">Why do ye not understand my speech? [even] because ye cannot hear my word.</verse>
  <verse number="44">Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And because I tell [you] the truth, ye believe me not.</verse>
  <verse number="46">Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?</verse>
  <verse number="47">He that is of God heareth God’s words: ye therefore hear [them] not, because ye are not of God.</verse>
  <verse number="48">Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?</verse>
  <verse number="49">Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.</verse>
  <verse number="50">And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</verse>
  <verse number="51">Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.</verse>
  <verse number="52">Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.</verse>
  <verse number="53">Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?</verse>
  <verse number="54">Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:</verse>
  <verse number="55">Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.</verse>
  <verse number="56">Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw [it], and was glad.</verse>
  <verse number="57">Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?</verse>
  <verse number="58">Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.</verse>
  <verse number="59">Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.</verse>
