<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="1" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Paul, [a] called apostle of Jesus Christ, by God’s will, and Sosthenes the brother,</verse>
  <verse number="2">to the assembly of God which is in Corinth, to [those] sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours:</verse>
  <verse number="3">Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I thank my God always about you, in respect of the grace of God given to you in Christ Jesus;</verse>
  <verse number="5">that in everything ye have been enriched in him, in all word [of doctrine], and all knowledge,</verse>
  <verse number="6">(according as the testimony of the Christ has been confirmed in you,)</verse>
  <verse number="7">so that ye come short in no gift, awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="8">who shall also confirm you to [the] end, unimpeachable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="9">God [is] faithful, by whom ye have been called into [the] fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Now I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all say the same thing, and that there be not among you divisions; but that ye be perfectly united in the same mind and in the same opinion.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For it has been shewn to me concerning you, my brethren, by those of [the house of] Chloe, that there are strifes among you.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But I speak of this, that each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Is the Christ divided? has Paul been crucified for you? or have ye been baptised unto the name of Paul?</verse>
  <verse number="14">I thank God that I have baptised none of you, unless Crispus and Gaius,</verse>
  <verse number="15">that no one may say that I have baptised unto my own name.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Yes, I baptised also the house of Stephanas; for the rest I know not if I have baptised any other.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For Christ has not sent me to baptise, but to preach glad tidings; not in wisdom of word, that the cross of the Christ may not be made vain.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For the word of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but to us that are saved it is God’s power.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and set aside the understanding of the understanding ones.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Where [is the] wise? where scribe? where disputer of this world? has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?</verse>
  <verse number="21">For since, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom has not known God, God has been pleased by the foolishness of the preaching to save those that believe.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Since Jews indeed ask for signs, and Greeks seek wisdom;</verse>
  <verse number="23">but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews an offence, and to nations foolishness;</verse>
  <verse number="24">but to those that [are] called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ God’s power and God’s wisdom.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For consider your calling, brethren, that [there are] not many wise according to flesh, not many powerful, not many high-born.</verse>
  <verse number="27">But God has chosen the foolish things of the world, that he may put to shame the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world, that he may put to shame the strong things;</verse>
  <verse number="28">and the ignoble things of the world, and the despised, has God chosen, [and] things that are not, that he may annul the things that are;</verse>
  <verse number="29">so that no flesh should boast before God.</verse>
  <verse number="30">But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who has been made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and holiness, and redemption;</verse>
  <verse number="31">that according as it is written, He that boasts, let him boast in [the] Lord.</verse>
