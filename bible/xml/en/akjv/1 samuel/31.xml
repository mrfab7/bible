  <verse number="1">Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the Philistines followed hard on Saul and on his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchishua, Saul’s sons.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Then said Saul to his armor bearer, Draw your sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armor bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell on it.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And when his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on his sword, and died with him.</verse>
  <verse number="6">So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armor bearer, and all his men, that same day together.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelled in them.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the house of their idols, and among the people.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And they put his armor in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul;</verse>
  <verse number="12">All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.</verse>
