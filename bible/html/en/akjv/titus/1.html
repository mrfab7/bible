<div class="chapter" data-book="Titus" data-chapter="1" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">But has in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed to me according to the commandment of God our Savior;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">To Titus, my own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For this cause left I you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed you:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not self-willed, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the disputers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">This witness is true. Why rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">To the pure all things are pure: but to them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and to every good work reprobate.</p>
