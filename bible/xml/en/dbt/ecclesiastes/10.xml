  <verse number="1">Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to stink [and] ferment; [so] a little folly is weightier than wisdom [and] honour.</verse>
  <verse number="2">The heart of a wise [man] is at his right hand; but a fool’s heart at his left.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his sense faileth [him], and he saith to every one [that] he is a fool.</verse>
  <verse number="4">If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for quietness pacifieth great offences.</verse>
  <verse number="5">There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, as an error [that] proceedeth from the ruler:</verse>
  <verse number="6">folly is set in great dignities, but the rich sit in a low place.</verse>
  <verse number="7">I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He that diggeth a pit falleth into it; and whoso breaketh down a hedge, a serpent biteth him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Whoso removeth stones is hurt therewith; he that cleaveth wood is endangered thereby.</verse>
  <verse number="10">If the iron be blunt, and one do not whet the edge, then must he apply more strength; but wisdom is profitable to give success.</verse>
  <verse number="11">If the serpent bite before enchantment, then the charmer hath no advantage.</verse>
  <verse number="12">The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool swallow up himself.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The beginning of the words of his mouth is folly; and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And the fool multiplieth words: [yet] man knoweth not what shall be; and what shall be after him, who will tell him?</verse>
  <verse number="15">The labour of fools wearieth them, because they know not how to go to the city.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning!</verse>
  <verse number="17">Happy art thou, O land, when thy king is a son of nobles, and thy princes eat in [due] season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!</verse>
  <verse number="18">By much sloth fulness the framework falleth in; and through idleness of the hands the house drippeth.</verse>
  <verse number="19">A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh life merry; but money answereth everything.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Curse not the king, no, not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for the bird of the air will carry the voice, and that which hath wings will tell the matter.</verse>
