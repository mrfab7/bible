<p class="verse" data-verse="1">A mild answer breaketh wrath: but a harsh word stirreth up fury.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The tongue of the wise adorneth knowledge: but the mouth of fools bubbleth out folly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The eyes of the Lord in every place behold the good and the evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">A peaceable tongue is a tree of life: but that which is immoderate, shall crush the spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">A fool laugheth at the instruction of his father: but he that regardeth reproofs shall become prudent. In abundant justice there is the greatest strength: but the devices of the wicked shall be rooted out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The house of the just is very much strength: and in the fruits of the wicked is trouble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The lips of the wise shall disperse knowledge: the heart of fools shall be unlike.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The victims of the wicked are abominable to the Lord: the vows of the just are acceptable.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The heart of the wise seeketh instruction: and the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">All the days of the poor are evil: a secure mind is like a continual feast.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Better is a little with the fear of the Lord, than great treasures without content,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">It is better to be invited to herbs with love, than to a fatted calf with hatred.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">A passionate man stirreth up strifes: he that is patient appeaseth those that are stirred up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The way of the slothful is as a hedge of thorns; the way of the just is without offence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">A wise son maketh a father joyful: but the foolish man despiseth his mother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Folly is joy to the fool: and the wise man maketh straight his steps.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Designs are brought to nothing where there is no counsel: but where there are many counsellors, they are established.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">A man rejoiceth in the sentence of his mouth: and a word in due time is best.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The path of life is above for the wise, that he may decline from the lowest hell.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="28">The mind of the just studieth obedience: the mouth of the wicked over floweth with evils.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">The Lord is far from the wicked: and he will hear the prayers of the just.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">The light of the eyes rejoiceth the soul: a good name maketh the bones fat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">The ear that heareth the reproofs of life, shall abide in the midst of the wise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">He that rejecteth instruction, despiseth his own soul: but he that yieldeth to reproof possesseth understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">The fear of the Lord is the lesson of wisdom: and humility goeth before glory.</p>
