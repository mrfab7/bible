<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Job answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Truly ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I also have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you; and who knoweth not such things as these?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I am to be one that is a derision to his friend, I who call upon +God, and whom he will answer: a derision is the just upright [man].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He that is ready to stumble with the foot is a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The tents of desolators are in peace, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand +God bringeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowl of the heavens, and they shall tell thee;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee; and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Who knoweth not in all these, that the hand of Jehovah hath wrought this?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the spirit of all flesh of man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Doth not the ear try words, as the palate tasteth food?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">With the aged is wisdom, and in length of days understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">With him is wisdom and might; he hath counsel and understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Behold, he breaketh down, and it is not built again; he shutteth up a man, and there is no opening.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up; and he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">With him is strength and effectual knowledge; the deceived and the deceiver are his.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and judges maketh he fools;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He weakeneth the government of kings, and bindeth their loins with a fetter;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He leadeth priests away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">He depriveth of speech the trusty, and taketh away the judgment of the elders;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He poureth contempt upon nobles, and slackeneth the girdle of the mighty;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out into light the shadow of death;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them; he spreadeth out the nations, and bringeth them in;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He taketh away the understanding of the chiefs of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a pathless waste.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like a drunkard.</p>
