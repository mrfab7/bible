  <verse number="1">The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:</verse>
  <verse number="2">To whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.</verse>
  <verse number="3">It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, to the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="5">Before I formed you in the belly I knew you; and before you came forth out of the womb I sanctified you, and I ordained you a prophet to the nations.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But the LORD said to me, Say not, I am a child: for you shall go to all that I shall send you, and whatever I command you you shall speak.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with you to deliver you, said the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the LORD said to me, Behold, I have put my words in your mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="10">See, I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Jeremiah, what see you? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Then said the LORD to me, You have well seen: for I will hasten my word to perform it.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the word of the LORD came to me the second time, saying, What see you? And I said, I see a seething pot; and the face thereof is toward the north.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Then the LORD said to me, Out of the north an evil shall break forth on all the inhabitants of the land.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For, see, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, said the LORD; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.</verse>
  <verse number="17">You therefore gird up your loins, and arise, and speak to them all that I command you: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound you before them.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For, behold, I have made you this day a defended city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And they shall fight against you; but they shall not prevail against you; for I am with you, said the LORD, to deliver you.</verse>
