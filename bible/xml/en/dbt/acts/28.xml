  <verse number="1">And when we got safe [to land] we then knew that the island was called Melita.</verse>
  <verse number="2">But the barbarians shewed us no common kindness; for, having kindled a fire, they took us all in because of the rain that was falling and because of the cold.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Paul having gathered a [certain] quantity of sticks together in a bundle and laid [it] on the fire, a viper coming out from the heat seized his hand.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And when the barbarians saw the beast hanging from his hand, they said to one another, This man is certainly a murderer, whom, [though] saved out of the sea, Nemesis has not allowed to live.</verse>
  <verse number="5">He however, having shaken off the beast into the fire, felt no harm.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But they expected that he would have swollen or fallen down suddenly dead. But when they had expected a long time and saw nothing unusual happen to him, changing their opinion, they said he was a god.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Now in the country surrounding that place were the lands belonging to the chief man of the island, by name Publius, who received us and gave [us] hospitality three days in a very friendly way.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And it happened that the father of Publius lay ill of fever and dysentery; to whom Paul entered in, and having prayed and laid his hands on him cured him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But this having taken place, the rest also who had sicknesses in the island came and were healed:</verse>
  <verse number="10">who also honoured us with many honours, and on our leaving they made presents to us of what should minister to our wants.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And after three months we sailed in a ship which had wintered in the island, an Alexandrian, with [the] Dioscuri for its ensign.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And having come to Syracuse we remained three days.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Whence, going in a circuitous course, we arrived at Rhegium; and after one day, the wind having changed to south, on the second day we came to Puteoli,</verse>
  <verse number="14">where, having found brethren, we were begged to stay with them seven days. And thus we went to Rome.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And thence the brethren, having heard about us, came to meet us as far as Appii Forum and Tres Tabernae, whom when Paul saw, he thanked God and took courage.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And when we came to Rome, [the centurion delivered up the prisoners to the praetorian prefect, but] Paul was allowed to remain by himself with the soldier who kept him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And it came to pass after three days, that he called together those who were the chief of the Jews; and when they had come together he said to them, Brethren, I having done nothing against the people or the customs of our forefathers, have been delivered a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans,</verse>
  <verse number="18">who having examined me were minded to let me go, because there was nothing worthy of death in me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">But the Jews speaking against it, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, not as having anything to accuse my nation of.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For this cause therefore I have called you to [me] to see and to speak to you; for on account of the hope of Israel I have this chain about me.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And they said to him, For our part, we have neither received letters from Judaea concerning thee, nor has any one of the brethren who has arrived reported or said anything evil concerning thee.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But we beg to hear of thee what thou thinkest, for as concerning this sect it is known to us that it is everywhere spoken against.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And having appointed him a day many came to him to the lodging, to whom he expounded, testifying of the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and the prophets, from early morning to evening.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And some were persuaded of the things which were said, but some disbelieved.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And being disagreed among themselves they left; Paul having spoken one word, Well spoke the Holy Spirit through Esaias the prophet to our fathers,</verse>
  <verse number="26">saying, Go to this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear and not understand, and seeing ye shall see and not perceive.</verse>
  <verse number="27">For the heart of this people has become fat, and they hear heavily with their ears, and they have closed their eyes; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Be it known to you therefore, that this salvation of God has been sent to the nations; they also will hear [it].</verse>
  <verse number="29">[And he having said this, the Jews went away, having great reasoning among themselves.]</verse>
  <verse number="30">And he remained two whole years in his own hired lodging, and received all who came to him,</verse>
  <verse number="31">preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, with all freedom unhinderedly.</verse>
