<chapter book="James" number="3" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Be not many teachers, my brethren, knowing that we shall receive greater judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For we all often offend. If any one offend not in word, he [is] a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body too.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Behold, we put the bits in the mouths of the horses, that they may obey us, and we turn round their whole bodies.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Behold also the ships, which are so great, and driven by violent winds, are turned about by a very small rudder, wherever the pleasure of the helmsman will.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Thus also the tongue is a little member, and boasts great things. See how little a fire, how large a wood it kindles!</verse>
  <verse number="6">and the tongue [is] fire, the world of unrighteousness; the tongue is set in our members, the defiler of the whole body, and which sets fire to the course of nature, and is set on fire of hell.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For every species both of beasts and of birds, both of creeping things and of sea animals, is tamed and has been tamed by the human species;</verse>
  <verse number="8">but the tongue can no one among men tame; [it is] an unsettled evil, full of death-bringing poison.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Therewith bless we the Lord and Father, and therewith curse we men made after [the] likeness of God.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Out of the same mouth goes forth blessing and cursing. It is not right, my brethren, that these things should be thus.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Does the fountain, out of the same opening, pour forth sweet and bitter?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Can, my brethren, a fig produce olives, or a vine figs? Neither [can] salt [water] make sweet water.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Who [is] wise and understanding among you; let him shew out of a good conversation his works in meekness of wisdom;</verse>
  <verse number="14">but if ye have bitter emulation and strife in your hearts, do not boast and lie against the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="15">This is not the wisdom which comes down from above, but earthly, natural, devilish.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For where emulation and strife [are], there [is] disorder and every evil thing.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But the wisdom from above first is pure, then peaceful, gentle, yielding, full of mercy and good fruits, unquestioning, unfeigned.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But [the] fruit of righteousness in peace is sown for them that make peace.</verse>
