<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, sent, (not from men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, having raised him from the dead;)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And with me all the brethren, to the churches of Galatia:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Having given himself for our sins, that he might take us away out of this present evil time, according to the will of God and our Father:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">To whom the glory for the time of times. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I wonder that so quickly are ye transferred from him having called you by the grace of Christ to another good news:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Which is not another; except some are troubling you, and wishing to pervert the good news of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But also if we, or a messenger from heaven, announce good news to you, more than what: we have announced to you, let him be anathema.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">As we said before, also now say I again, If any announce to you good news above what ye received, let him be anathema.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For now do I persuade men, or God? or seek I to please men? for if I had yet pleased men, I should not have been the servant of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">But I make known to you, brethren, the good news announced by me that it is not according to man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For I neither received it from man, neither was I taught, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For ye heard of my turning about when in Judaism, that in excess I drove out the church of God, and laid it waste:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And I advanced in Judaism above many like in my race, being more abundantly zealous of paternal traditions.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And when God was contented, having separated me from my mother’s womb, and having called me, by his grace,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">To reveal his Son in me, that I might announce him the good news in the nations; I consulted not with flesh and blood:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them sent before me; but I went away to Arabia, and again returned to Damascus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Then after three years I came up to Jerusalem to examine Peter, and remained with him fifteen days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And other of the sect I saw not, except James the Lord’s brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And what I write to you, behold, before God, that I lie not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Then came I to the regions of Syria and Cilicia;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And was unknown by face to the churches of Judea there in Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And only they had heard, That he then driving us out, now announces the good news, the faith which he then felt the absence of.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And they glorified God in me.</p>
