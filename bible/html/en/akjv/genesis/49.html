<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Jacob called to his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Gather yourselves together, and hear, you sons of Jacob; and listen to Israel your father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Unstable as water, you shall not excel; because you went up to your father’s bed; then defiled you it: he went up to my couch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Simeon and Levi are brothers; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">O my soul, come not you into their secret; to their assembly, my honor, be not you united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their self-will they dig down a wall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Judah, you are he whom your brothers shall praise: your hand shall be in the neck of your enemies; your father’s children shall bow down before you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Judah is a lion’s whelp: from the prey, my son, you are gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and to him shall the gathering of the people be.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Binding his foal to the vine, and his ass’s colt to the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his border shall be to Zidon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant to tribute.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that bites the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">I have waited for your salvation, O LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Naphtali is a hind let loose: he gives goodly words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">But his bow stayed in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from there is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Even by the God of your father, who shall help you; and by the Almighty, who shall bless you with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lies under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">The blessings of your father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors to the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brothers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Benjamin shall shred as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spoke to them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And he charged them, and said to them, I am to be gathered to my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a burial plot.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered to his people.</p>
