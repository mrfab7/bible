  <verse number="1">In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him: ‘Thus saith the LORD: Set thy house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.’</verse>
  <verse number="2">Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD,</verse>
  <verse number="3">and said: ‘Remember now, O LORD, I beseech Thee, how I have walked before Thee in truth and with a whole heart, and have done that which is good in Thy sight.’ And Hezekiah wept sore.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="5">Go, and say to Hezekiah: Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father: I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears; behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And this shall be the sign unto thee from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that He hath spoken:</verse>
  <verse number="8">behold, I will cause the shadow of the dial, which is gone down on the sun-dial of Ahaz, to return backward ten degrees.’ So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness.</verse>
  <verse number="10">I said: In the noontide of my days I shall go, Even to the gates of the nether-world; I am deprived of the residue of my years.</verse>
  <verse number="11">I said: I shall not see the LORD, Even the LORD in the land of the living; I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="12">My habitation is plucked up and carried away from me As a shepherd’s tent; I have rolled up like a weaver my life; He will cut me off from the thrum; From day even to night wilt Thou make an end of me.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The more I make myself like unto a lion until morning, The more it breaketh all my bones; From day even to night wilt Thou make an end of me.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Like a swallow or a crane, so do I chatter, I do moan as a dove; Mine eyes fail with looking upward. O LORD, I am oppressed, be Thou my surety.</verse>
  <verse number="15">What shall I say? He hath both spoken unto me, And Himself hath done it; I shall go softly all my years for the bitterness of my soul.</verse>
  <verse number="16">O Lord, by these things men live, And altogether therein is the life of my spirit; Wherefore recover Thou me, and make me to live.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Behold, for my peace I had great bitterness; But Thou hast in love to my soul delivered it From the pit of corruption; For Thou hast cast all my sins behind Thy back.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For the nether-world cannot praise Thee, Death cannot celebrate Thee; They that go down into the pit cannot hope for Thy truth.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The living, the living, he shall praise Thee, As I do this day; The father to the children shall make known Thy truth.</verse>
  <verse number="20">The LORD is ready to save me; Therefore we will sing songs to the stringed instruments All the days of our life in the house of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And Isaiah said: ‘Let them take a cake of figs, and lay it for a plaster upon the boil, and he shall recover.’</verse>
  <verse number="22">And Hezekiah said. ‘What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?’</verse>
