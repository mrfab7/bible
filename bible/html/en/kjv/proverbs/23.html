<p class="verse" data-verse="1">When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what [is] before thee:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And put a knife to thy throat, if thou [be] a man given to appetite.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Be not desirous of his dainties: for they [are] deceitful meat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for [riches] certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Eat thou not the bread of [him that hath] an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For as he thinketh in his heart, so [is] he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart [is] not with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The morsel [which] thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy sweet words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For their redeemer [is] mighty; he shall plead their cause with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Withhold not correction from the child: for [if] thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Let not thine heart envy sinners: but [be thou] in the fear of the LORD all the day long.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be cut off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe [a man] with rags.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Buy the truth, and sell [it] not; [also] wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begetteth a wise [child] shall have joy of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For a whore [is] a deep ditch; and a strange woman [is] a narrow pit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">She also lieth in wait as [for] a prey, and increaseth the transgressors among men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, [when] it moveth itself aright.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">They have stricken me, [shalt thou say, and] I was not sick; they have beaten me, [and] I felt [it] not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.</p>
