  <verse number="2">Then Jacob said to his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:</verse>
  <verse number="3">And let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And they gave to Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and the ear-rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And they journeyed: and the terror of God was on the cities that were round them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.</verse>

  <verse number="7">And he erected there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el; because there God appeared to him, when he fled from the face of his brother.</verse>
