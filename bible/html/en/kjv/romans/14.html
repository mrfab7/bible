<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, [but] not to doubtful disputations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day [alike]. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He that regardeth the day, regardeth [it] unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard [it]. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For it is written, [As] I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in [his] brother’s way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that [there is] nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him [it is] unclean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But if thy brother be grieved with [thy] meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Let not then your good be evil spoken of:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For he that in these things serveth Christ [is] acceptable to God, and approved of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed [are] pure; but [it is] evil for that man who eateth with offence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">[It is] good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor [any thing] whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Hast thou faith? have [it] to thyself before God. Happy [is] he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because [he eateth] not of faith: for whatsoever [is] not of faith is sin.</p>
