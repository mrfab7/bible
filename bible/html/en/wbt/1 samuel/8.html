<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Samuel" data-chapter="8" data-translation="Webster Bible Translation" data-translation-id="wbt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Now the name of his first-born was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: they were judges in Beer-sheba.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Then all the elders of Israel assembled, and came to Samuel to Ramah,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And said to him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us: and Samuel prayed to the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken to the voice of the people in all that they say to thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them out of Egypt even to this day, by which they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Now therefore hearken to their voice: yet protest solemnly to them, and show them the manner of the king that will reign over them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And Samuel told all the words of the LORD to the people that asked of him a king.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some will run before his chariots.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to till his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And he will take your daughters to be confectioneries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your olive-yards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And he will take your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and your most choice young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye will be his servants.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen for yourselves; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Nevertheless, the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, No; but we will have a king over us;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken to their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said to the men of Israel, Go ye every man to his city.</p>
