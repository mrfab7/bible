<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the youth Samuel is serving Jehovah before Eli, and the word of Jehovah hath been precious in those days—there is no vision broken forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And it cometh to pass, at that time, that Eli is lying down in his place, and his eyes have begun to be dim—he is not able to see.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And the lamp of God is not yet extinguished, and Samuel is lying down in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God is,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">and Jehovah calleth unto Samuel, and he saith, ‘Here am I.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And he runneth unto Eli, and saith, ‘Here am I, for thou hast called for me;’ and he saith, ‘I called not; turn back, lie down;’ and he goeth and lieth down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Jehovah addeth to call again Samuel, and Samuel riseth and goeth unto Eli, and saith, ‘Here am I, for thou hast called for me;’ and he saith, ‘I have not called, my son, turn back, lie down.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And Samuel hath not yet known Jehovah, and the word of Jehovah is not yet revealed unto him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Jehovah addeth to call Samuel the third time, and he riseth and goeth unto Eli, and saith, ‘Here am I, for thou hast called for me;’ and Eli understandeth that Jehovah is calling to the youth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And Eli saith to Samuel, ‘Go, lie down, and it hath been, if He doth call unto thee, that thou hast said, Speak, Jehovah, for Thy servant is hearing;’ and Samuel goeth and lieth down in his place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And Jehovah cometh, and stationeth Himself, and calleth as time by time, ‘Samuel, Samuel;’ and Samuel saith, ‘Speak, for Thy servant is hearing.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And Jehovah saith unto Samuel, ‘Lo, I am doing a thing in Israel, at which the two ears of every one hearing it do tingle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">In that day I establish unto Eli all that I have spoken unto his house, beginning and completing;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">and I have declared to him that I am judging his house—to the age, for the iniquity which he hath known, for his sons are making themselves vile, and he hath not restrained them,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">and therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli: the iniquity of the house of Eli is not atoned for, by sacrifice, and by offering—unto the age.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Samuel lieth till the morning, and openeth the doors of the house of Jehovah, and Samuel is afraid of declaring the vision unto Eli.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Eli calleth Samuel, and saith, ‘Samuel, my son;’ and he saith, ‘Here am I.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And he saith, ‘What is the word which He hath spoken unto thee? I pray thee, hide it not from me; so doth God do to thee, and so doth He add, if thou hidest from me a word of all the words that He hath spoken unto thee.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And Samuel declareth to him the whole of the words, and hath not hid from him; and he saith, ‘It is Jehovah; that which is good in His eyes He doth.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And Samuel groweth up, and Jehovah hath been with him, and hath not let fall any of his words to the earth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">and all Israel know, from Dan even unto Beer-Sheba, that Samuel is established for a prophet to Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Jehovah addeth to appear in Shiloh, for Jehovah hath been revealed unto Samuel, in Shiloh, by the word of Jehovah.</p>
