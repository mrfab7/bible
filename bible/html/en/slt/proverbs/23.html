<p class="verse" data-verse="1">If thou shalt sit to eat with a ruler, understanding, thou shalt understand what is before thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And put a knife to thy swallow if thou the possessor of a soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Thou shalt not long for his dainties: and it is the bread of lies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thou shalt not labor to become rich: cease from thy wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Wilt thou cause thine eyes to fly upon it and it is not? for making, it will make to it wings; as an eagle and it flew to the heavens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Thou shalt not eat the bread of an evil eye, and ye shall not long for its dainties:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Like him estimating evil in his soul, so is he: Eat and drink, he will say to thee; and his heart not with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Thy morsel which thou didst eat thou shalt vomit forth and destroy thy pleasant words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">In the ears of the foolish thou shalt not speak, for he will despise for the understanding of thy words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Thou shalt not remove the old bound; and into the field of the orphans thou shalt not come:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For he redeeming them, he is strong; he will contend their contention with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Bring thy heart to instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Thou shalt not withhold instruction from youth: if thou shalt strike him with a rod he shall not die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Thou shalt strike him with the rod, and thou shalt deliver his soul from hades.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">My son, if thy heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And my reins shall exult in the speaking of thy lips uprightnesses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Thy heart shall not envy against those sinning: but be in the fear of Jehovah all the day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But there is a latter state, and thine expectation shall not be cut off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thy heart right in the way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Thou shalt not be with those drinking wine to excess, and with squanderers of flesh to them:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For the drunkard and the squanderer shall be dispossessed: and slumber shall clothe with rags.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Hear to thy father that begat thee, and thou shalt not despise thy mother when growing old.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Buy the truth, and thou shalt not sell wisdom and instruction and understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The father of the just one rejoicing, shall rejoice: he shall beget a wise one and shall rejoice in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Thy father shall rejoice, and thy mother, and she begetting thee shall exult.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">My son, thou shalt give thy heart to me, and thine eyes shall delight in my way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For a harlot is a deep ditch; and a strong woman a narrow well.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">She also will lie in wait as for prey, and she will add those transgressing among men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">To whom wo? to whom want? to whom strife? to whom complaint? to whom wounds gratuitously? to whom dark flashings of the eyes?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">To those remaining at the wine; to those going to seek mixed wine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Thou shalt not look upon wine when it shall be red, when it shall give its eye in the cup, it will go about in uprightnesses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Its latter state it will bite as serpent, and sting as a viper.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Thine eyes shall see strange women, and thy heart shall speak perverseness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And thou wert as he lying down in the heart of the sea, and as he lying down upon the head of the mast.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">They struck me, I was not pained; they beat me, I knew not: when shall I awake? I will add, I will yet seek it.</p>
