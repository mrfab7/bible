<chapter book="Jeremiah" number="32" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">The word which was to Jeremiah from Jehovah in the tenth year to Zedekiah king of Judah, this year the eighteenth year to Nebuchadnezzar.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And then the strength of the king of Babel pressed upon Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the enclosure of the prison which was in the house of the king of Judah.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For Zedekiah king of Judah shut him up, saying, Wherefore prophesiest thou, saying, Thus said Jehovah, Behold me giving this city into the hand of the king of Babel, and he took it.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape from the hand of the Chaldeans, for giving, he shall be given into the hand of the king of Babel, and speaking to him, his mouth with his mouth, and his eyes shall see his eyes:</verse>
  <verse number="5">And he shall call Zedekiah to go to Babel, and he shall be there till my reviewing him, says Jehovah: if ye shall war with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Jeremiah will say, The word of Jehovah was to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="7">Behold, Hanameel son of Shallum thine uncle, coming to thee, saying, Buy to thee my field which is in Anathoth: for to thee the judgment of redemption today.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Hanameel mine uncle’s son will come to me according to the word of Jehovah, to the enclosure of the prison, and he will say to me, Buy now, my field, which is in Anathoth, in the land of Benjamin: for to thee judgment of possession, and to thee the redemption; buy to thee, and I shall know that this is the word of Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And I shall buy the field of Hanameel son of mine uncle, which is in Anathoth; and I shall weigh to him seven shekels and ten of silver.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And I shall write in a book, and seal and affirm witnesses, and weigh the silver in the balances.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And I will take the book of the purchase, being sealed, the command and laws, and being unrolled:</verse>
  <verse number="12">And I shall give the writing of the purchase to Baruch, son of Neriah, son of Maaseiah, before the eyes of Hanameel mine uncle, and before the eyes of the witnesses, writing in the book of the purchase before the eves of all the Jews sitting in the enclosure of the prison.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And I shall command Baruch before their eyes, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="14">Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, take these writings, this writing of the purchase, and the sealed, and this writing unrolled, and give them into an earthern vessel, so that they shall stand many days.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, Houses and fields and vineyards shall yet be bought in this land.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And I shall pray to Jehovah, after my giving the writing of the purchase to Baruch son of Neriah, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="17">Thou Lord Jehovah! behold thou madest the heavens and the earth by thy great power and by thine arm stretched forth; any word shall not be separated from thee.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Doing kindness to thousands and requiting the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their sons after them: The Great, The Strong God, Jehovah of armies his name.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Great of counsel, and vast of doing: for thine eyes being opened upon all the ways of the sons of men to give to each according to his ways, and to the fruit of his doings:</verse>
  <verse number="20">Who set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even to this day, and in Israel, and in man; and thou wilt make to thee a name according to this day.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And thou wilt bring forth thy people Israel from the land of Egypt with signs and with wonders, and with a strong hand and with an arm stretched forth, and with great fear:</verse>
  <verse number="22">And thou wilt give to them this land which thou swarest to their fathers to give to them, a land flowing milk and honey.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And they will come in and possess it; and they heard not to thy voice, and they went not in thy law; all which thou didst command to them to do they did not, and thou wilt cause all this evil to befall them.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Behold the mounds, they came to the city to take it; and the city was given into the hand of the Chaldees warring against it from the face of the sword, and the famine, and the death; and it was what thou spakest; and behold thee seeing.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And thou saidst to me, O Lord Jehovah, Buy to thee the field for silver, and affirm witnesses; and the city was given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And the word of Jehovah will be to Jeremiah, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="27">Behold, I am Jehovah, God of all flesh: is there any word separated from me?</verse>
  <verse number="28">For this, thus said Jehovah, Behold me giving this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, and he took it.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And the Chaldeans warring against this city came, and they burnt this city in fire, and they burnt it and the houses which they burnt incense upon their roofs to Baal, and they poured out libations to other gods to irritate me.</verse>
  <verse number="30">For the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah were only doing evil in mine eyes from their youth: for the sons of Israel were only irritating me with the work of their hands, says Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="31">For this city was to me for mine anger and for my wrath, from the day which they built it and even to this day, to remove it from my face.</verse>
  <verse number="32">For all the evil of the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah which they did to irritate me, they, their kings, their chiefs, their priests, and their prophets, and the man Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And they will turn to me the neck and not the face: and teaching them, and rising early and teaching, and they not hearing to receive instruction.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And they will set their abominations in the house which my name was called upon it, to defile it.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And they will build the heights of Baal which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through to Molech, which I commanded them not; and it came not up upon my heart to do this abomination to cause Judah to sin.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And now for this, thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, to this city of which ye are saying, It was given into the hand of the king of Babel by sword and by famine, and by death.</verse>
  <verse number="37">Behold me gathering them from all the lands where I thrust them away there in mine anger, and in my wrath, and in great anger; and I turned them back to this place, and I caused them to dwell with confidence.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And they were to me for a people, and I will be to them for God.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And I gave to them one heart and one way, to fear me all the days, for good to them and to their sons after them.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And I cut out to them an eternal covenant that I will not turn back from after them, to do them good; and I will give my fear in their heart not to turn away from me.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And I rejoiced over them to do them good, and I planted them in this land in truth with all my heart and with all my soul.</verse>
  <verse number="42">For thus said Jehovah, As I brought to this people all this great evil, so I bring upon them all the good which I speak concerning them.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And the field was purchased in in this land which ye are saying, It is a desolation without man and cattle; it was given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</verse>
  <verse number="44">They shall buy fields with silver, and write thou in the book, and seal and affirm witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in round about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountain, and in the cities of the low country, and in the cities of the south: for I will turn back their captivity, says Jehovah.</verse>
