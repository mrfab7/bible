  <verse number="1">Again he began to teach by the seaside. A great multitude was gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat in the sea, and sat down. All the multitude were on the land by the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="2">He taught them many things in parables, and told them in his teaching,</verse>
  <verse number="3">“Listen! Behold, the farmer went out to sow,</verse>
  <verse number="4">and it happened, as he sowed, some seed fell by the road, and the birds came and devoured it.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Others fell on the rocky ground, where it had little soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of soil.</verse>
  <verse number="6">When the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Others fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing. Some brought forth thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times as much.”</verse>
  <verse number="9">He said, “Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.”</verse>
  <verse number="10">When he was alone, those who were around him with the twelve asked him about the parables.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He said to them, “To you is given the mystery of the Kingdom of God, but to those who are outside, all things are done in parables,</verse>
  <verse number="12">that ‘seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest perhaps they should turn again, and their sins should be forgiven them.’”</verse>
  <verse number="13">He said to them, “Don’t you understand this parable? How will you understand all of the parables?</verse>
  <verse number="14">The farmer sows the word.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The ones by the road are the ones where the word is sown; and when they have heard, immediately Satan comes, and takes away the word which has been sown in them.</verse>
  <verse number="16">These in the same way are those who are sown on the rocky places, who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy.</verse>
  <verse number="17">They have no root in themselves, but are short-lived. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they stumble.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Others are those who are sown among the thorns. These are those who have heard the word,</verse>
  <verse number="19">and the cares of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Those which were sown on the good ground are those who hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, some thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times.”</verse>
  <verse number="21">He said to them, “Is the lamp brought to be put under a basket or under a bed? Isn’t it put on a stand?</verse>
  <verse number="22">For there is nothing hidden, except that it should be made known; neither was anything made secret, but that it should come to light.</verse>
  <verse number="23">If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.”</verse>
  <verse number="24">He said to them, “Take heed what you hear. With whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you, and more will be given to you who hear.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For whoever has, to him will more be given, and he who doesn’t have, even that which he has will be taken away from him.”</verse>
  <verse number="26">He said, “The Kingdom of God is as if a man should cast seed on the earth,</verse>
  <verse number="27">and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he doesn’t know how.</verse>
  <verse number="28">For the earth bears fruit: first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.</verse>
  <verse number="29">But when the fruit is ripe, immediately he puts forth the sickle, because the harvest has come.”</verse>
  <verse number="30">He said, “How will we liken the Kingdom of God? Or with what parable will we illustrate it?</verse>
  <verse number="31">It’s like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, though it is less than all the seeds that are on the earth,</verse>
  <verse number="32">yet when it is sown, grows up, and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches, so that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow.”</verse>
  <verse number="33">With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Without a parable he didn’t speak to them; but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.</verse>
  <verse number="35">On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, “Let’s go over to the other side.”</verse>
  <verse number="36">Leaving the multitude, they took him with them, even as he was, in the boat. Other small boats were also with him.</verse>
  <verse number="37">A big wind storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so much that the boat was already filled.</verse>
  <verse number="38">He himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion, and they woke him up, and told him, “Teacher, don’t you care that we are dying?”</verse>
  <verse number="39">He awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Peace! Be still!” The wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</verse>
  <verse number="40">He said to them, “Why are you so afraid? How is it that you have no faith?”</verse>
  <verse number="41">They were greatly afraid, and said to one another, “Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?”</verse>
