<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My spirit being destroyed my days were extinct; the graves are for me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">If not mockings with me? and shall not mine eye lodge in their bitterness?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Set up now, pledge me with thee: who is he will strike for my hand?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For thou didst hide their heart from understanding; for this thou wilt not exalt them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He will commence evils for a position, and the eyes of his sons shall be consumed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He set me for a parable of the peoples, and I shall be one spit upon to the face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And mine eye shall be weak from vexation, and my thoughts as a shadow all of them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The upright shall be astonished upon this, and the innocent Shall arouse himself against the profane.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the just shall hold on his way, and the clean one of hands shall add strength.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But ye all shall turn back, and come ye now, and I shall not find a wise one among you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">My days passed away, my purposes were broken; the possessions of my heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">They will set the night for day: the light being near from the face of darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If I shall wait, hades is my house: in darkness I spread my bed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I called to the pit: Grave, thou my father: and to the worm, My mother, and my sister.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And where now my hope? and my hope who shall regard it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">They shall go down to the bars of hades if together we shall go down to the dust.</p>
