<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Job again took up his parable, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">As God liveth, who hath taken away my right, And the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">(For my life is yet whole in me, And the spirit of God is in my nostrils);</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Surely my lips shall not speak uprighteousness, Neither shall my tongue utter deceit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Far be it from me that I should justify you: Till I die I will not put away mine integrity from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Let mine enemy be as the wicked, And let him that riseth up against me be as the unrighteous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For what is the hope of the godless, though he get him gain, When God taketh away his soul?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Will God hear his cry, When trouble cometh upon him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Will he delight himself in the Almighty, And call upon God at all times?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I will teach you concerning the hand of God; That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; Why then are ye become altogether vain?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">This is the portion of a wicked man with God, And the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword; And his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Those that remain of him shall be buried in death, And his widows shall make no lamentation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Though he heap up silver as the dust, And prepare raiment as the clay;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, And the innocent shall divide the silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He buildeth his house as the moth, And as a booth which the keeper maketh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He lieth down rich, but he shall not be gathered to his fathers; He openeth his eyes, and he is not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Terrors overtake him like waters; A tempest stealeth him away in the night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth; And it sweepeth him out of his place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For God shall hurl at him, and not spare: He would fain flee out of his hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Men shall clap their hands at him, And shall hiss him out of his place.</p>
