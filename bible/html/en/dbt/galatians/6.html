<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Brethren, if even a man be taken in some fault, ye who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, considering thyself lest thou also be tempted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Bear one anotherâ€™s burdens, and thus fulfil the law of the Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For if any man reputes himself to be something, being nothing, he deceives himself;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">but let each prove his own work, and then he will have his boast in what belongs to himself alone, and not in what belongs to another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For each shall bear his own burden.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Let him that is taught in the word communicate to him that teaches in all good things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Be not deceived: God is not mocked; for whatever a man shall sow, that also shall he reap.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For he that sows to his own flesh, shall reap corruption from the flesh; but he that sows to the Spirit, from the Spirit shall reap eternal life:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">but let us not lose heart in doing good; for in due time, if we do not faint, we shall reap.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">So then, as we have occasion, let us do good towards all, and specially towards those of the household of faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">See how long a letter I have written to you with my own hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">As many as desire to have a fair appearance in [the] flesh, these compel you to be circumcised, only that they may not be persecuted because of the cross of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For neither do they that are circumcised themselves keep the law; but they wish you to be circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But far be it from me to boast save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom [the] world is crucified to me, and I to the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For [in Christ Jesus] neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision; but new creation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace upon them and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For the rest let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the brands of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit, brethren. Amen.</p>
