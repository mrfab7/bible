  <verse number="2">Now, you son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyrus;</verse>
  <verse number="3">And say to Tyrus, O you that are situate at the entry of the sea, which are a merchant of the people for many isles, Thus said the Lord GOD; O Tyrus, you have said, I am of perfect beauty.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Your borders are in the middle of the seas, your builders have perfected your beauty.</verse>
  <verse number="5">They have made all your ship boards of fir trees of Senir: they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for you.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Of the oaks of Bashan have they made your oars; the company of the Ashurites have made your benches of ivory, brought out of the isles of Chittim.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which you spread forth to be your sail; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered you.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were your mariners: your wise men, O Tyrus, that were in you, were your pilots.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in you your caulkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in you to occupy your merchandise.</verse>
  <verse number="10">They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in your army, your men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in you; they set forth your comeliness.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The men of Arvad with your army were on your walls round about, and the Gammadims were in your towers: they hanged their shields on your walls round about; they have made your beauty perfect.</verse>

  <verse number="20">Dedan was your merchant in precious clothes for chariots.</verse>

  <verse number="23">Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad, were your merchants.</verse>
  <verse number="24">These were your merchants in all sorts of things, in blue clothes, and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords, and made of cedar, among your merchandise.</verse>
  <verse number="25">The ships of Tarshish did sing of you in your market: and you were replenished, and made very glorious in the middle of the seas.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Your rowers have brought you into great waters: the east wind has broken you in the middle of the seas.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Your riches, and your fairs, your merchandise, your mariners, and your pilots, your caulkers, and the occupiers of your merchandise, and all your men of war, that are in you, and in all your company which is in the middle of you, shall fall into the middle of the seas in the day of your ruin.</verse>
  <verse number="28">The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of your pilots.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And all that handle the oar, the mariners, and all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand on the land;</verse>
  <verse number="30">And shall cause their voice to be heard against you, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust on their heads, they shall wallow themselves in the ashes:</verse>
  <verse number="31">And they shall make themselves utterly bald for you, and gird them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for you with bitterness of heart and bitter wailing.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for you, and lament over you, saying, What city is like Tyrus, like the destroyed in the middle of the sea?</verse>
  <verse number="33">When your wares went forth out of the seas, you filled many people; you did enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of your riches and of your merchandise.</verse>
  <verse number="34">In the time when you shall be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters your merchandise and all your company in the middle of you shall fall.</verse>
  <verse number="35">All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at you, and their kings shall be sore afraid, they shall be troubled in their countenance.</verse>
  <verse number="36">The merchants among the people shall hiss at you; you shall be a terror, and never shall be any more.</verse>
