<chapter book="Job" number="33" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Howbeit, Job, I pray thee, hear my speech, and hearken to all my words.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Behold now, I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="3">My words shall utter the uprightness of my heart: and that which my lips know they shall speak sincerely.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty giveth me life.</verse>
  <verse number="5">If thou canst, answer thou me; set thy words in order before me, stand forth.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Behold, I am toward God even as thou art: I also am formed out of the clay.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my pressure be heavy upon thee.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="9">I am clean, without transgression; I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me:</verse>
  <verse number="10">Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy;</verse>
  <verse number="11">He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Behold, I will answer thee, in this thou art not just; for God is greater than man.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For God speaketh once, yea twice, though man regardeth it not.</verse>
  <verse number="15">In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;</verse>
  <verse number="16">Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,</verse>
  <verse number="17">That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man;</verse>
  <verse number="18">He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="19">He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and with continual strife in his bones:</verse>
  <verse number="20">So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.</verse>
  <verse number="21">His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Yea, his soul draweth near unto the pit, and his life to the destroyers.</verse>
  <verse number="23">If there be with him an angel, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man what is right for him;</verse>
  <verse number="24">Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom.</verse>
  <verse number="25">His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s; he returneth to the days of his youth:</verse>
  <verse number="26">He prayeth unto God, and he is favourable unto him; so that he seeth his face with joy: and he restoreth unto man his righteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="27">He singeth before men, and saith, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not:</verse>
  <verse number="28">He hath redeemed my soul from going into the pit, and my life shall behold the light.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Lo, all these things doth God work, twice, yea thrice, with a man,</verse>
  <verse number="30">To bring back his soul from the pit, that he may be enlightened with the light of the living.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.</verse>
  <verse number="32">If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.</verse>
  <verse number="33">If not, hearken thou unto me: hold thy peace, and I will teach thee wisdom.</verse>
