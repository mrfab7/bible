<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the apostle and chief priest of our profession, Christ Jesus,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">being stedfast to Him who did appoint him, as also Moses in all his house,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">for of more glory than Moses hath this one been counted worthy, inasmuch as more honour than the house hath he who doth build it,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">for every house is builded by some one, and He who the all things did build is God,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">and Moses indeed was stedfast in all his house, as an attendant, for a testimony of those things that were to be spoken,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and Christ, as a Son over his house, whose house are we, if the boldness and the rejoicing of the hope unto the end we hold fast.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Wherefore, (as the Holy Spirit saith, ‘To-day, if His voice ye may hear—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">ye may not harden your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of the temptation in the wilderness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">in which tempt Me did your fathers, they did prove Me, and saw My works forty years;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, Always do they go astray in heart, and these have not known My ways;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">so I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest—!’)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">See, brethren, lest there shall be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in the falling away from the living God,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">but exhort ye one another every day, while the To-day is called, that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of the sin,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">for partakers we have become of the Christ, if the beginning of the confidence unto the end we may hold fast,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">in its being said, ‘To-day, if His voice ye may hear, ye may not harden your hearts, as in the provocation,’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">for certain having heard did provoke, but not all who did come out of Egypt through Moses;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">but with whom was He grieved forty years? was it not with those who did sin, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">and to whom did He swear that they shall not enter into His rest, except to those who did not believe?—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">and we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.</p>
