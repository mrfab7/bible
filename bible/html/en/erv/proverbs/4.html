<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Hear, my sons, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For I give you good doctrine; forsake ye not my law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For I was a son unto my father, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And he taught me, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words; keep my commandments, and live:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Get wisdom, get understanding; forget it not, neither decline from the words of my mouth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee; love her, and she shall keep thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: yea, with all thou hast gotten get understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">She shall give to thine head a chaplet of grace: a crown of beauty shall she deliver to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in paths of uprightness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and if thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Enter not into the path of the wicked, and walk not in the way of evil men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Avoid it, pass not by it; turn from it, and pass on.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But the path of the righteous is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Make level the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.</p>
