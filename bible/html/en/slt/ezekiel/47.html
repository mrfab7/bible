<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And he will turn me back to the door of the house; and behold, waters coming forth from under the threshold of the house to the east: for the face of the house eastward, and the waters coming down from under from the right shoulder of the house, from the south to the altar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And he will bring me forth the way of the gate of the north; and he will turn me round the way without to the gate without the way looking to the east; and behold, waters flowing from the right shoulder.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And in the going forth of the man eastward, and the line in his hand, and he will measure a thousand by the cubit, and he will cause me to pass through the waters; the waters of the soles.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And he will measure a thousand, and he will cause me to pass through the waters; the waters of the knees. And he will measure a thousand, and cause me to pass through; the Waters of the loins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And he will measure a thousand, a torrent which I shall not be able to pass through: for the waters rose, waters of swimming, a torrent which shall not be passed through.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And he will say to me, Didst thou see, son of man? And he will cause me to go, and he will turn me back upon the lip of the torrent.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And he will say to me, These waters going forth to the circuit of the east, and they went down to Arabia and came into the sea: being brought forth to the sea and the waters were healed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And it was every living soul that shall creep, to all where the two torrents shall come there, shall live: and there was very many fish, because these waters came there: and they shall be healed and all lived where the torrent shall come there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And it was the fisherman shall stand upon it from the fountain of the kid, even to the fountain of the two calves; they shall be a spreading for nets; their fish shall be according to its kind as the fish of the great sea very many.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Its marshes and its pools and they shall not be healed; they were given marshes to salt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And upon the torrent shall come up upon its lip, from hence and from thence, every tree of food, its leaf shall not fade, and its fruit shall not be consumed: for its months it shall bear early fruit, for its waters from the holy place they come forth: and its fruits were for food and its leaf for medicine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Thus said the Lord Jehovah: This the bound by which ye shall inherit the land for the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph two portions.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And ye inherited it, each as his brother: which I lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers: and this land fell to you in inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And this the bound of the land to the side of the north from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, to go to Zedad.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the bound of Damascus and between the bound of Hamath; the middle enclosure which is to the bound of Hauran.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the bound from the sea was the enclosure of fountains, the hound of Damascus, and the north northward, and the bound of Hamath: And the side of the north.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And the side of the east from between Hauran and from between Damascus, and from between Gilead and from between the land of Israel, Jordan, from the bound to the east sea shall ye measure: and the east side.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And the south side southward from Tamar even to the waters of contradiction in Kadesh, the torrent to the the great sea: and the south side south</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And the side of the sea the great sea from the bound, even to over against the entrance of Hamath. This the side of the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And ye divided that land to you for the tribes of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And ye shall cause it to fall in inheritance to you, and to the strangers sojourning in the midst of you, who begat sons in the midst of you: and they were to you as the nation among the sons of Israel with you they shall fall in the inheritance in the midst of the tribes of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And it was in the tribe which the stranger sojourned with it there shall ye give his inheritance, says the Lord Jehovah.</p>
