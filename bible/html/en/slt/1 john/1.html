<p class="verse" data-verse="1">What was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld, and our own hands felt, concerning the word of life;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">(And the life was manifested, and we have seen, and we testify, and announce to you the eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us;)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">What we have seen and heard we announce to you, that ye also might have communion with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And these we write to you, that your joy might be filled up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And this is the message which we have heard from him, and we announce to you, that God is light, and no darkness is in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If we say that we have communion with him, and walk in darkness, we are deceived, and do not the truth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have communion with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from every sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">If we acknowledge our sins, he is faithful and just that he let go sins to us, and cleanse us from all injustice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.</p>
