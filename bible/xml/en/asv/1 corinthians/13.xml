<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="13" translation="American Standard Version" translationID="asv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am become sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And if I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And if I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profiteth me nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Love suffereth long, and is kind; love envieth not; love vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,</verse>
  <verse number="5">doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not its own, is not provoked, taketh not account of evil;</verse>
  <verse number="6">rejoiceth not in unrighteousness, but rejoiceth with the truth;</verse>
  <verse number="7">beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Love never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall be done away; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall be done away.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For we know in part, and we prophesy in part;</verse>
  <verse number="10">but when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away.</verse>
  <verse number="11">When I was a child, I spake as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child: now that I am become a man, I have put away childish things.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For now we see in a mirror, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know fully even as also I was fully known.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love.</verse>
