<div class="chapter" data-book="Micah" data-chapter="1" data-translation="Smith's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="slt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The word of Jehovah which was to Micah the Morasthite, in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah, who saw upon Shomeron and Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hear, all ye peoples; attend, O earth, and its fulness, and the Lord Jehovah shall be among you for a witness, Jehovah from his holy temple.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For behold, Jehovah will come forth from his place, and come down and tread upon the heights of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And the mountains melted under him, and the valleys shall be cleft as wax from the face of the fire, as waters cast down in a descent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For the transgression of Jacob all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel What the transgression of Jacob? Is it not Shomeron? And what the heights of Judah? Are they not Jerusalem?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And I set Shomeron for the rubbish of the field, for the plantings of a vineyard: and I poured down its stones into the valley, and I will uncover its foundations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And all her carved images shall be beaten down, and all her gifts shall be burnt in fire, and all her images I will set a desolation: for she gathered from the gift of a harlot, and they shall turn back even to the gift of a harlot.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For this I will lament and wail; I will go stripped and naked: I will make wailing as jackals, and mourning as the daughters of the ostrich.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For her blow is incurable, for it came even to Judah; he touched even to the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Ye shall not announce in Gath; weeping, ye shall not weep: in the house of dust roll thyself in dust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Pass away for you, thou fair one inhabiting the nakedness of shame: she inhabiting the place of flocks shall not go forth to the wailing of the house of firm root; he shall take from you his standing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For she dwelling in bitterness was anxious for good: but evil came down from Jehovah to the gate of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Make fast the chariot to the steed, thou inhabitress of the smitten: she the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion: for in thee were found the transgressions of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For this thou shalt give a sending forth upon the possession of Gath: the houses of falsehood are for falsehood to the kings of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Yet I will bring to thee him possessing, O inhabitress at the head: he shall come even to Adullam, the glory of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Make bald, and shave for the sons of thy delights; increase thy baldness as the eagle; for they were carried away captive from thee.</p>
