<p class="verse" data-verse="1">â€œBut now they mock me, men younger than I am, whose fathers I would have refused to put with my sheep dogs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">What use to me was the strength of their hands, since their vigor had left them?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Gaunt from poverty and hunger, they gnawed the dry land, and the desolate wasteland by night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">They plucked mallow among the shrubs, and the roots of the broom tree were their food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">They were banished from among men, shouted at like thieves,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">so that they lived on the slopes of the wadis, among the rocks and in holes in the ground.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">They cried out among the shrubs and huddled beneath the nettles.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">A senseless and nameless brood, they were driven off the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And now they mock me in song; I have become a byword among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">They abhor me and keep far from me; they do not hesitate to spit in my face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Because God has unstrung my bow and afflicted me, they have cast off restraint in my presence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The rabble arises at my right; they lay snares for my feet and build siege ramps against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They tear up my path; they profit from my destruction, with no one to restrain them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">They advance as through a wide breach; through the ruins they keep rolling in.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Terrors are turned loose against me; they drive away my dignity as by the wind, and my prosperity has passed like a cloud.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And now my soul is poured out within me; days of affliction grip me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Night pierces my bones, and my gnawing pains never rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">With great force He grasps my garment; He seizes me by the collar of my tunic.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He throws me into the mud, and I have become like dust and ashes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">I cry out to You for help, but You do not answer; when I stand up, You merely look at me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">You have ruthlessly turned on me; You oppose me with Your strong hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">You snatch me up into the wind and drive me before it; You toss me about in the storm.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Yes, I know that You will bring me down to death, to the place appointed for all the living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Yet no one stretches out his hand against a ruined man when he cries for help in his distress.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Have I not wept for those in trouble? Has my soul not grieved for the needy?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">But when I hoped for good, evil came; when I looked for light, darkness fell.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">I am churning within and cannot rest; days of affliction confront me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">I go about blackened, but not by the sun. I stand up in the assembly and cry for help.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">I have become a brother of jackals, a companion of ostriches.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">My skin grows black and peels, and my bones burn with fever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">My harp is tuned to mourning and my flute to the sound of weeping.</p>
