<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Corinthians" data-chapter="16" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">On the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God has prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And when I come, whomsoever you shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Now I will come to you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And it may be that I will abide, yes, and winter with you, that you may bring me on my journey wherever I go.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For a great door and effectual is opened to me, and there are many adversaries.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he works the work of the Lord, as I also do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come to me: for I look for him with the brothers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come to you with the brothers: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Watch you, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Let all your things be done with charity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I beseech you, brothers, (you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">That you submit yourselves to such, and to every one that helps with us, and labors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge you them that are such.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">All the brothers greet you. Greet you one another with an holy kiss.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">The salutation of me Paul with my own hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.</p>
