<chapter book="2 Timothy" number="2" translation="American Standard Version" translationID="asv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Thou therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the things which thou hast heard from me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="4">No soldier on service entangleth himself in the affairs of this life; that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And if also a man contend in the games, he is not crowned, except he have contended lawfully.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The husbandman that laboreth must be the first to partake of the fruits.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Consider what I say; for the Lord shall give thee understanding in all things.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel:</verse>
  <verse number="9">wherein I suffer hardship unto bonds, as a malefactor; but the word of God is not bound.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Faithful is the saying: For if we died with him, we shall also live with him:</verse>
  <verse number="12">if we endure, we shall also reign with him: if we shall deny him, he also will deny us:</verse>
  <verse number="13">if we are faithless, he abideth faithful; for he cannot deny himself.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them in the sight of the Lord, that they strive not about words, to no profit, to the subverting of them that hear.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Give diligence to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, handling aright the word of truth.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But shun profane babblings: for they will proceed further in ungodliness,</verse>
  <verse number="17">and their word will eat as doth a gangrene: of whom is Hymenæus and Philetus;</verse>
  <verse number="18">men who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already, and overthrow the faith of some.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Howbeit the firm foundation of God standeth, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his: and, Let every one that nameth the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some unto honor, and some unto dishonor.</verse>
  <verse number="21">If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, meet for the master’s use, prepared unto every good work.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But flee youthful lusts, and follow after righteousness, faith, love, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But foolish and ignorant questionings refuse, knowing that they gender strifes.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And the Lord’s servant must not strive, but be gentle towards all, apt to teach, forbearing,</verse>
  <verse number="25">in meekness correcting them that oppose themselves; if peradventure God may give them repentance unto the knowledge of the truth,</verse>
  <verse number="26">and they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him unto his will.</verse>
