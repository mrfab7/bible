<chapter book="Revelation" number="12" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And a great sign was seen in heaven; a woman surrounded by the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:</verse>
  <verse number="2">And having in the womb she cries, having the pains of childbirth, and making trial to bring forth.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And another sign was seen in heaven; and behold a great fiery red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his heads seven diadems.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And his tail draws the third of the stars of heaven, and he cast them into the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman about to bring forth, that when she should bring forth he might devour her child.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And she brought forth a son, a male, who is about to rule all nations with an iron rod: and her child was snatched up to God, and his throne.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the woman fled into the desert where she has a place prepared from God, that they might nourish her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And war was in heaven; and Michael and his angels waged war against the dragon; and the dragon waged war and his angels,</verse>
  <verse number="8">And were not strong; nor was place more found for them in heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the great dragon was cast out, the old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, he deceiving the whole habitable globe: he was cast into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And I heard a great voice saying in heaven, Now was salvation and power, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ for the accuser of our brethren was cast down, he accusing them before our God, day and night.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And they conquered him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their souls till death.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For this rejoice, ye heavens, and they dwelling in them. Woe to them inhabiting the earth and the sea! for the devil came down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has little time.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And when the dragon saw that he was cast into the earth, he drove out the woman who brought forth the male.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly to the desert, to her place, where she is nourished there a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And the serpent cast after the woman water out of his mouth as a river, that he might make her torn away by a river.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed down the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the dragon was angry at the woman, and went out to make war with the rest of her seed, those keeping the commands of God, and having the testimony of Jesus Christ.</verse>
