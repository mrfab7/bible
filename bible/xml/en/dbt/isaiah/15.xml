  <verse number="2">He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, to the high places, to weep; Moab howleth over Nebo, and over Medeba; on all their heads is baldness, every beard is cut off.</verse>
  <verse number="3">In their streets they are girded with sackcloth; on their roofs, and in their broadways, every one howleth, melted into tears.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Heshbon crieth, and Elealeh: their voice is heard unto Jahaz. Therefore the armed men of Moab cry out: his soul trembleth in him.</verse>
  <verse number="5">My heart crieth out for Moab; their fugitives [have fled] unto Zoar, unto Eglath-Sheli-shijah: for by the ascent of Luhith, with weeping they go up by it; for in the way of Horonaim they raise up a cry of destruction.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate; for the herbage is withered away, the grass hath failed, there is no green thing.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid up, do they carry away to the torrent of the willows.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For the cry goeth round about the borders of Moab; the howling thereof unto Eglaim, and the howling thereof unto Beer-elim.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For the waters of Dimon are full of blood, for I will lay yet more upon Dimon: a lion upon them that are escaped of Moab, and upon that which remaineth of the land.</verse>
