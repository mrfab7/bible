<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are you all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldens you that you answer?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I also could speak as you do: if your soul were in my soulâ€™s stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake my head at you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should assuage your grief.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But now he has made me weary: you have made desolate all my company.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And you have filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me bears witness to my face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He tears me in his wrath, who hates me: he gnashes on me with his teeth; my enemy sharpens his eyes on me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">They have gaped on me with their mouth; they have smitten me on the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">God has delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I was at ease, but he has broken me asunder: he has also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">His archers compass me round about, he splits my reins asunder, and does not spare; he pours out my gall on the ground.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">He breaks me with breach on breach, he runs on me like a giant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I have sewed sackcloth on my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Not for any injustice in my hands: also my prayer is pure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">O earth, cover not you my blood, and let my cry have no place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">My friends scorn me: but my eye pours out tears to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleads for his neighbor!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">When a few years are come, then I shall go the way from where I shall not return.</p>
