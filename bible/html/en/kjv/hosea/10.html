<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Israel [is] an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself: according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the LORD; what then should a king do to us?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Bethaven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof [that] rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">It shall be also carried unto Assyria [for] a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">[As for] Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And Ephraim [is as] an heifer [that is] taught, [and] loveth to tread out [the corn]; but I passed over upon her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, [and] Jacob shall break his clods.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for [it is] time to seek the LORD, till he come and rain righteousness upon you.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Betharbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon [her] children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness: in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.</p>
