<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="26" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honor is not seemly for a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the foolâ€™s back.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest you also be like to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He that sends a message by the hand of a fool cuts off the feet, and drinks damage.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the mouth of fools.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">As he that binds a stone in a sling, so is he that gives honor to a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">As a thorn goes up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in the mouths of fools.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The great God that formed all things both rewards the fool, and rewards transgressors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">As a dog returns to his vomit, so a fool returns to his folly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">See you a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope of a fool than of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The slothful man said, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">As the door turns on his hinges, so does the slothful on his bed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The slothful hides his hand in his bosom; it grieves him to bring it again to his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He that passes by, and meddles with strife belonging not to him, is like one that takes a dog by the ears.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">As a mad man who casts firebrands, arrows, and death,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">So is the man that deceives his neighbor, and said, Am not I in sport?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Where no wood is, there the fire goes out: so where there is no talebearer, the strife ceases.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a contentious man to kindle strife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with silver dross.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He that hates dissembles with his lips, and lays up deceit within him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">When he speaks fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations in his heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be showed before the whole congregation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Whoever digs a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolls a stone, it will return on him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">A lying tongue hates those that are afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth works ruin.</p>
