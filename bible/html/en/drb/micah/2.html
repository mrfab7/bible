<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Woe to you that devise that which is unprofitable, and work evil in your beds: in the morning light they execute it, because their hand is against God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And they have coveted fields, and taken them by violence, and houses they have forcibly taken away: and oppressed a man and his house, a man and his inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Therefore thus saith the Lord : Behold, I devise an evil against this family: from which you shall not withdraw your necks, and you shall not walk haughtily, for this is a very evil time.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">In that day a parable shall be taken up upon you, and a song shall be sung with melody by them that say: We are laid waste and spoiled: the portion of my people is changed: how shall he depart from me, whereas he is returning that will divide our land?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast the cord of a lot in the assembly of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Speak ye not, saying: It shall not drop upon these, confusion shall not take them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The house of Jacob saith: Is the spirit of the Lord straitened, or are these his thoughts? Are not my words good to him that walketh uprightly?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But my people, on the contrary, are risen up as an enemy: you have taken away the cloak off from the coat: and them that passed harmless you have turned to war.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">You have cast out the women of my people from their houses, in which they took delight: you have taken my praise for ever from their children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Arise ye, and depart, for there is no rest here for you. For that uncleanness of the land, it shall be corrupted with a grievous corruption.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Would God I were not a man that hath the spirit, and that I rather spoke a lie: I will let drop to thee of wine, and of drunkenness: and it shall be this people upon whom it shall drop.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I will assemble and gather together all of thee, O Jacob: I will bring together the remnant of Israel, I will put them together as a flock in the fold, as the sheep in the midst of the sheepcotes, they shall make a tumult by reason of the multitude of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For he shall go up that shall open the way before them: they shall divide, and pass through the gate, and shall come in by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the Lord at the head of them.</p>
