  <verse number="1">Then Job answered,</verse>
  <verse number="2">“Truly I know that it is so, but how can man be just with God?</verse>
  <verse number="3">If he is pleased to contend with him, he can’t answer him one time in a thousand.</verse>
  <verse number="4">God who is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who has hardened himself against him, and prospered?</verse>
  <verse number="5">He removes the mountains, and they don’t know it, when he overturns them in his anger.</verse>
  <verse number="6">He shakes the earth out of its place. Its pillars tremble.</verse>
  <verse number="7">He commands the sun, and it doesn’t rise, and seals up the stars.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He alone stretches out the heavens, and treads on the waves of the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He makes the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, and the rooms of the south.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He does great things past finding out; yes, marvelous things without number.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Behold, he goes by me, and I don’t see him. He passes on also, but I don’t perceive him.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Behold, he snatches away. Who can hinder him? Who will ask him, ‘What are you doing?’</verse>
  <verse number="13">“God will not withdraw his anger. The helpers of Rahab stoop under him.</verse>
  <verse number="14">How much less shall I answer him, And choose my words to argue with him?</verse>
  <verse number="15">Though I were righteous, yet I wouldn’t answer him. I would make supplication to my judge.</verse>
  <verse number="16">If I had called, and he had answered me, yet I wouldn’t believe that he listened to my voice.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For he breaks me with a storm, and multiplies my wounds without cause.</verse>
  <verse number="18">He will not allow me to catch my breath, but fills me with bitterness.</verse>
  <verse number="19">If it is a matter of strength, behold, he is mighty! If of justice, ‘Who,’ says he, ‘will summon me?’</verse>
  <verse number="20">Though I am righteous, my own mouth shall condemn me. Though I am blameless, it shall prove me perverse.</verse>
  <verse number="21">I am blameless. I don’t respect myself. I despise my life.</verse>
  <verse number="22">“It is all the same. Therefore I say he destroys the blameless and the wicked.</verse>
  <verse number="23">If the scourge kills suddenly, he will mock at the trial of the innocent.</verse>
  <verse number="24">The earth is given into the hand of the wicked. He covers the faces of its judges. If not he, then who is it?</verse>
  <verse number="25">“Now my days are swifter than a runner. They flee away, they see no good,</verse>
  <verse number="26">They have passed away as the swift ships, as the eagle that swoops on the prey.</verse>
  <verse number="27">If I say, ‘I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad face, and cheer up;’</verse>
  <verse number="28">I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that you will not hold me innocent.</verse>
  <verse number="29">I shall be condemned. Why then do I labor in vain?</verse>
  <verse number="30">If I wash myself with snow, and cleanse my hands with lye,</verse>
  <verse number="31">yet you will plunge me in the ditch. My own clothes shall abhor me.</verse>
  <verse number="32">For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, that we should come together in judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="33">There is no umpire between us, that might lay his hand on us both.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Let him take his rod away from me. Let his terror not make me afraid;</verse>
  <verse number="35">then I would speak, and not fear him, for I am not so in myself.</verse>
