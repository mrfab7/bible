<chapter book="Job" number="14" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble.</verse>
  <verse number="2">He comes forth like a flower, and is cut down: he flees also as a shadow, and continues not.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And does you open your eyes on such an one, and bring me into judgment with you?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with you, you have appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;</verse>
  <verse number="6">Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground;</verse>
  <verse number="9">Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But man dies, and wastes away: yes, man gives up the ghost, and where is he?</verse>
  <verse number="11">As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decays and dries up:</verse>
  <verse number="12">So man lies down, and rises not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.</verse>
  <verse number="13">O that you would hide me in the grave, that you would keep me secret, until your wrath be past, that you would appoint me a set time, and remember me!</verse>
  <verse number="14">If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.</verse>
  <verse number="15">You shall call, and I will answer you: you will have a desire to the work of your hands.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For now you number my steps: do you not watch over my sin?</verse>
  <verse number="17">My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and you sew up my iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And surely the mountains falling comes to nothing, and the rock is removed out of his place.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The waters wear the stones: you wash away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth; and you destroy the hope of man.</verse>
  <verse number="20">You prevail for ever against him, and he passes: you change his countenance, and send him away.</verse>
  <verse number="21">His sons come to honor, and he knows it not; and they are brought low, but he perceives it not of them.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But his flesh on him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.</verse>
