  <verse number="1">And the Lord went on, and said to Job :</verse>
  <verse number="2">Shall he that contendeth with God be so easily silenced? surely he that reproveth God, ought to answer him.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Then Job answered the Lord, and said :</verse>
  <verse number="4"></verse>
  <verse number="5">One thing I have spoken, which I wish I had not said : and another, to which I will add no more.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the Lord answering Job out of the whirlwind, said :</verse>
  <verse number="7">Gird up thy loins like a man : I will ask thee, and do thou tell me.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Wilt thou make void my judgment : and condemn me, that thou mayst be justified?</verse>
  <verse number="9">And hast thou an arm like God, and canst thou thunder with a voice like him?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Clothe thyself with beauty, and set thyself up on high and be glorious, and put on goodly garments.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Scatter the proud in thy indignation, and behold every arrogant man, and humble him.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Look on all that are proud, and confound them, and crush the wicked in their place.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Hide them in the dust together, and plunge their faces into the pit.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Then I will confess that thy right hand is able to save thee.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Behold behemoth whom I made with thee, he eateth grass like an ox.</verse>
  <verse number="16">His strength is in his loins, and his force in the navel of his belly.</verse>
  <verse number="17">He setteth up his tail like a cedar, the sinews of his testicles are wrapped together.</verse>
  <verse number="18">His bones are like pipes of brass, his gristle like plates of iron.</verse>
  <verse number="19">He is the beginning of the ways of God, who made him, he will apply his sword.</verse>
  <verse number="20">To him the mountains bring forth grass : there all the beasts of the field shall play.</verse>
  <verse number="21">He sleepeth under the shadow, in the covert of the reed, and in moist places.</verse>
  <verse number="22">The shades cover his shadow, the willows of the brook shall compass him about.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Behold, he will drink up a river, and not wonder : and he trusteth that the Jordan may run into his mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="24">In his eyes as with a hook he shall take him, and bore through his nostrils with stakes.</verse>
