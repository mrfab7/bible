  <verse number="1">And the third day a marriage happened in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there,</verse>
  <verse number="2">and also Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage;</verse>
  <verse number="3">and wine having failed, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, ‘Wine they have not;’</verse>
  <verse number="4">Jesus saith to her, ‘What—to me and to thee, woman? not yet is mine hour come.’</verse>
  <verse number="5">His mother saith to the ministrants, ‘Whatever he may say to you—do.’</verse>
  <verse number="6">And there were there six water-jugs of stone, placed according to the purifying of the Jews, holding each two or three measures.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Jesus saith to them, ‘Fill the water-jugs with water;’ and they filled them—unto the brim;</verse>
  <verse number="8">and he saith to them, ‘Draw out, now, and bear to the director of the apartment;’ and they bare.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And as the director of the apartment tasted the water become wine, and knew not whence it is, (but the ministrants knew, who have drawn the water,) the director of the feast doth call the bridegroom,</verse>
  <verse number="10">and saith to him, ‘Every man, at first, the good wine doth set forth; and when they may have drunk freely, then the inferior; thou didst keep the good wine till now.’</verse>
  <verse number="11">This beginning of the signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory, and his disciples believed in him;</verse>
  <verse number="12">after this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples; and there they remained not many days.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the passover of the Jews was nigh, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,</verse>
  <verse number="14">and he found in the temple those selling oxen, and sheep, and doves, and the money-changers sitting,</verse>
  <verse number="15">and having made a whip of small cords, he put all forth out of the temple, also the sheep, and the oxen; and of the money-changers he poured out the coins, and the tables he overthrew,</verse>
  <verse number="16">and to those selling the doves he said, ‘Take these things hence; make not the house of my Father a house of merchandise.’</verse>
  <verse number="17">And his disciples remembered that it is written, ‘The zeal of Thy house did eat me up;’</verse>
  <verse number="18">the Jews then answered and said to him, ‘What sign dost thou shew to us—that thou dost these things?’</verse>
  <verse number="19">Jesus answered and said to them, ‘Destroy this sanctuary, and in three days I will raise it up.’</verse>
  <verse number="20">The Jews, therefore, said, ‘Forty and six years was this sanctuary building, and wilt thou in three days raise it up?’</verse>
  <verse number="21">but he spake concerning the sanctuary of his body;</verse>
  <verse number="22">when, then, he was raised out of the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this to them, and they believed the Writing, and the word that Jesus said.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And as he was in Jerusalem, in the passover, in the feast, many believed in his name, beholding his signs that he was doing;</verse>
  <verse number="24">and Jesus himself was not trusting himself to them, because of his knowing all men,</verse>
  <verse number="25">and because he had no need that any should testify concerning man, for he himself was knowing what was in man.</verse>
