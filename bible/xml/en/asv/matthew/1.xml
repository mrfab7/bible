  <verse number="18">Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And Joseph her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But when he thought on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And she shall bring forth a son; and thou shalt call his name JESUS; for it is he that shall save his people from their sins.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Now all this is come to pass, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="23">Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, And they shall call his name Immanuel;which is, being interpreted, God with us.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took unto him his wife;</verse>
  <verse number="25">and knew her not till she had brought forth a son: and he called his name JESUS.</verse>
