  <verse number="1">Wo to sons turning aside, says Jehovah, to make counsel and not from me; and to cover a covering, and not my spirit so as to add sin upon sin:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Going to come down to Egypt, and my mouth they asked not; to be strengthened by the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the strength of Pharaoh was to you for shame, and the refuge in the shadow of Egypt for reproach.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For his chiefs were in Zoan, and his messengers will reach to Hanes.</verse>
  <verse number="5">All acted wickedly for a people who will not profit them, not for help and not for profiting, but for shame and also for a reproach.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The burden of quadrupeds of the south: into the land of straits and distress, the lioness and the lion from them, the viper and the burning flying they will lift up upon the shoulder of young asses, their riches, and upon the humps of camels their treasures, for a people who shall not profit.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose; therefore I called to this their violence ceased.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Now go, write it to them upon a tablet, and engrave it upon a book, and it shall be for the latter day, forever even forever.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For this is a people of contradiction, sons of lies, sons who will not to hear the law of Jehovah.</verse>

  <verse number="11">Remove from the way, turn aside from the path, cause to cease from before us the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Therefore thus said the Holy One of Israel, Because ye rejected in this word, and ye will trust in violence and perverseness, and ye will do upon it.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For this, this iniquity shall be to you as a breach falling, gushing out in a high wall, of which the breaking will come suddenly at a moment.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And he broke it as the breaking of a vessel of the potter’s being crushed; he will not spare: and there shall not be found in its crushing a sherd to take fire from the burning, and to skim off water from the reservoir.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For thus said Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, In turning back and in rest shall ye be saved; in quiet and in trust shall be your strength, and ye would not.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And ye will say, No; for upon horses we will flee: for this ye shall flee: and upon the swift will we ride; for this they pursuing you shall be swift.</verse>
  <verse number="17">One thousand from before the rebuke of one; from before the rebuke of five shall ye flee: till ye were left as a mast upon the head of the mountain, and as a signal upon the hill.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And for this Jehovah will wait to compassionate you, and for this he will be lifted up to pity you, for Jehovah is a God of judgment: happy all they waiting for him.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For the people shall dwell in Zion in Jerusalem: weeping, thou shalt not weep: pitying, he will pity thee at the voice of thy cry; for in his hearing, he answered thee.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Jehovah gave to you the bread of straits and the waters of oppression, and he will no more cover those teaching thee, and thine eyes shall be seeing those teaching thee:</verse>
  <verse number="21">And thine ears shall hear the word from after thee, saying, This the way, go ye in it when ye shall turn to the right, and when ye shall turn to the left.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And defile ye the thin covering of the carved images of thy silver, and the overlaying of the molten things of thy gold: thou shalt scatter them as a menstruous cloth, thou shalt say to it, Go forth.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And he gave the rain of thy seed which thou shalt sow the earth and bread of the increase of the earth: and it was fat and fertile, thy cattle shall feed in that day in a large meadow.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And the oxen and the young asses working the land shall eat salted provender which was winnowed with the fan and by the winnower.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And there was upon every mountain being lofty and every hill lifted up, brooks and streams of water in the day of much slaughter, in the falling of the towers.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And the light of the moon was as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun, shall be seven fold, as the light of seven days, in the day Jehovah bound up the breaking of his people, and he will heal the wound of his smiting.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Behold, the name of Jehovah coming from far off, burning his wrath, and its lifting up heavy: his lips they were full of anger, and his tongue as consuming fire:</verse>
  <verse number="28">And his spirit as the torrent overflowing, shall divide even to the neck, to shake the nations in the sieve of ruin: and a curb upon the cheeks of the people, causing to err.</verse>
  <verse number="29">The song shall be to you as by night, consecrating a festival and gladness of heart, as he going with a pipe to come into the mountain of Jehovah to the rock of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And Jehovah caused the swelling of his voice to be heard, and he will cause the letting down of his arm to be seen in the anger of his wrath, and the flame of a consuming fire, violent rain and tempest, and the stone of hail,</verse>
  <verse number="31">For from the voice of Jehovah shall Assur be broken down, he will smite with a rod.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And it was every one passing by the rod of foundation which Jehovah shall cause to rest upon him, with drums and with harps: and in battles of moving to and fro shall he war with with it.</verse>
  <verse number="33">For tophet was set in order from yesterday; also it was prepared; for the king, he made deep, he made broad, its pile fire and much wood; the breath of Jehovah as a torrent of pitch burned upon it.</verse>
