<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now late on sabbath, as it was the dusk of the next day after sabbath, came Mary of Magdala and the other Mary to look at the sepulchre.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of [the] Lord, descending out of heaven, came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And his look was as lightning, and his clothing white as snow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And for fear of him the guards trembled and became as dead men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the angel answering said to the women, Fear not ye, for I know that ye seek Jesus the crucified one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He is not here, for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And go quickly and say to his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and behold, he goes before you into Galilee, there shall ye see him. Behold, I have told you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And going out quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, they ran to bring his disciples word.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And as they went to bring his disciples word, behold also, Jesus met them, saying, Hail! And they coming up took him by the feet, and did him homage.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Then Jesus says to them, Fear not; go, bring word to my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there they shall see me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And as they went, behold, some of the watch went into the city, and brought word to the chief priests of all that had taken place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And having assembled with the elders, and having taken counsel, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">saying, Say that his disciples coming by night stole him [while] we [were] sleeping.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And if this should come to the hearing of the governor, we will persuade him, and save you from all anxiety.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And they took the money and did as they had been taught. And this report is current among the Jews until this day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But the eleven disciples went into Galilee to the mountain which Jesus had appointed them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And when they saw him, they did homage to him: but some doubted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And Jesus coming up spoke to them, saying, All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Go [therefore] and make disciples of all the nations, baptising them to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have enjoined you. And behold, I am with you all the days, until the completion of the age.</p>
