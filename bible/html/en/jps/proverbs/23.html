<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="23" data-translation="JPS Tanakh 1917 OT" data-translation-id="jps" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, Consider well him that is before thee;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And put a knife to thy throat, If thou be a man given to appetite.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Be not desirous of his dainties; Seeing they are deceitful food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Weary not thyself to be rich; Cease from thine own wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Wilt thou set thine eyes upon it? it is gone; For riches certainly make themselves wings, Like an eagle that flieth toward heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, Neither desire thou his dainties;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For as one that hath reckoned within himself, so is he: ‘Eat and drink’, saith he to thee; But his heart is not with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, And lose thy sweet words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Speak not in the ears of a fool; For he will despise the wisdom of thy words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Remove not the ancient landmark; And enter not into the fields of the fatherless;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For their Redeemer is strong; He will plead their cause with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Apply thy heart unto instruction, And thine ears to the words of knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Withhold not correction from the child; For though thou beat him with the rod, he will not die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Thou beatest him with the rod, And wilt deliver his soul from the nether-world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">My son, if thy heart be wise, My heart will be glad, even mine;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Yea, my reins will rejoice, When thy lips speak right things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Let not thy heart envy sinners, But be in the fear of the LORD all the day;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For surely there is a future; And thy hope shall not be cut off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Hear thou, my son, and be wise, And guide thy heart in the way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Be not among winebibbers; Among gluttonous eaters of flesh;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty; And drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Hearken unto thy father that begot thee, And despise not thy mother when she is old.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Buy the truth, and sell it not; Also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice; And he that begetteth a wise child will have joy of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Let thy father and thy mother be glad, And let her that bore thee rejoice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">My son, give me thy heart, And let thine eyes observe my ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For a harlot is a deep ditch; And an alien woman is a narrow pit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">She also lieth in wait as a robber, And increaseth the faithless among men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Who crieth: ‘Woe’? who: ‘Alas’? Who hath contentions? who hath raving? Who hath wounds without cause? Who hath redness of eyes?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">They that tarry long at the wine; They that go to try mixed wine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, When it giveth its colour in the cup, When it glideth down smoothly;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">At the last it biteth like a serpent, And stingeth like a basilisk.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Thine eyes shall behold strange things, And thy heart shall utter confused things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, Or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">They have struck me, and I felt it not, They have beaten me, and I knew it not; When shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.’</p>
