  <verse number="1">For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus in behalf of you Gentiles,—</verse>
  <verse number="2">if so be that ye have heard of the dispensation of that grace of God which was given me to you-ward;</verse>
  <verse number="3">how that by revelation was made known unto me the mystery, as I wrote before in few words,</verse>
  <verse number="4">whereby, when ye read, ye can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="5">which in other generations was not made known unto the sons of men, as it hath now been revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit;</verse>
  <verse number="6">to wit, that the Gentiles are fellow-heirs, and fellow-members of the body, and fellow-partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel,</verse>
  <verse number="7">whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach unto the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="9">and to make all men see what is the dispensation of the mystery which for ages hath been hid in God who created all things;</verse>
  <verse number="10">to the intent that now unto the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places might be made known through the church the manifold wisdom of God,</verse>
  <verse number="11">according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:</verse>
  <verse number="12">in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Wherefore I ask that ye may not faint at my tribulations for you, which are your glory.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father,</verse>
  <verse number="15">from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,</verse>
  <verse number="16">that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that ye may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inward man;</verse>
  <verse number="17">that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,</verse>
  <verse number="18">may be strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,</verse>
  <verse number="19">and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, that ye may be filled unto all the fulness of God.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,</verse>
  <verse number="21">unto him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all generations for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
