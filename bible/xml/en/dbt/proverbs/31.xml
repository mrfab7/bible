  <verse number="3">Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to them that destroy kings.</verse>
  <verse number="4">It is not for kings, Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, nor for rulers [to say], Where is the strong drink?</verse>
  <verse number="5">lest they drink And forget the law, And pervert the judgment of any of the children of affliction.</verse>

  <verse number="14">She is like the merchants’ ships: she bringeth her food from afar;</verse>
  <verse number="15">And she riseth while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and the day’s work to her maidens.</verse>
  <verse number="16">She considereth a field, and acquireth it; of the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.</verse>
  <verse number="17">She girdeth her loins with strength, and maketh strong her arms.</verse>

  <verse number="29">Many daughters have done worthily, but thou excellest them all.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Gracefulness is deceitful and beauty is vain; a woman [that] feareth Jehovah, she shall be praised.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her own works praise her in the gates.</verse>
