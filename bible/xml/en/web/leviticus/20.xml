  <verse number="1">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">“Moreover, you shall tell the children of Israel, ‘Anyone of the children of Israel, or of the strangers who live as foreigners in Israel, who gives any of his seed to Molech; he shall surely be put to death. The people of the land shall stone him with stones.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I also will set my face against that person, and will cut him off from among his people because he has given of his seed to Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.</verse>
  <verse number="4">If the people of the land all hide their eyes from that person, when he gives of his seed to Molech, and don’t put him to death;</verse>
  <verse number="5">then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all who play the prostitute after him, to play the prostitute with Molech, from among their people.</verse>
  <verse number="6">“‘The person that turns to those who are mediums, and to the wizards, to play the prostitute after them, I will even set my face against that person, and will cut him off from among his people.</verse>

  <verse number="17">“‘If a man takes his sister, his father’s daughter, or his mother’s daughter, and sees her nakedness, and she sees his nakedness; it is a shameful thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of the children of their people: he has uncovered his sister’s nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.</verse>

  <verse number="23">You shall not walk in the customs of the nation, which I am casting out before you: for they did all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.</verse>
  <verse number="24">But I have said to you, “You shall inherit their land, and I will give it to you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey.” I am Yahweh your God, who has separated you from the peoples.</verse>
  <verse number="25">“‘You shall therefore make a distinction between the clean animal and the unclean, and between the unclean fowl and the clean: and you shall not make yourselves abominable by animal, or by bird, or by anything with which the ground teems, which I have separated from you as unclean for you.</verse>
  <verse number="26">You shall be holy to me: for I, Yahweh, am holy, and have set you apart from the peoples, that you should be mine.</verse>
  <verse number="27">“‘A man or a woman that is a medium, or is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones; their blood shall be upon them.’”</verse>
