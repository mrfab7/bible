<p class="verse" data-verse="1">‘When I give healing to Israel, Then revealed is the iniquity of Ephraim, And the wickedness of Samaria, For they have wrought falsehood, And a thief doth come in, Stript off hath a troop in the street,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And they do not say to their heart, That all their evil I have remembered, Now compassed them have their doings, Over-against My face they have been.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">With their wickedness they make glad a king, And with their lies—princes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">All of them are adulterers, Like a burning oven of a baker, He ceaseth from stirring up after kneading the dough, till its leavening.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">A day of our king! Princes have polluted themselves with the poison of wine, He hath drawn out his hand with scorners.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For they have drawn near, As an oven is their heart, In their lying in wait all the night sleep doth their baker, Morning! he is burning as a flaming fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">All of them are warm as an oven, And they have devoured their judges, All their kings have fallen, There is none calling unto Me among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Ephraim! among peoples he mixeth himself, Ephraim hath been a cake unturned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Devoured have strangers his power, And he hath not known, Also old age hath sprinkled itself on him, And he hath not known.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And humbled hath been the excellency of Israel to his face, And they have not turned back unto Jehovah their God, Nor have they sought Him for all this.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And Ephraim is as a simple dove without heart, Egypt they called on—to Asshur they have gone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">When they go I spread over them My net, As the fowl of the heavens I bring them down, I chastise them as their company hath heard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Woe to them, for they wandered from Me, Destruction to them, for they transgressed against Me, And I—I ransom them, and they have spoken lies against Me,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And have not cried unto Me with their heart, but howl on their beds, For corn and new wine they assemble themselves, They turn aside against Me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And I instructed—I strengthened their arms, And concerning Me they think evil!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">They turn back—not to the Most High, They have been as a deceitful bow, Fall by sword do their princes, From the insolence of their tongue, This is their derision in the land of Egypt!</p>
