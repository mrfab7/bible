<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="4" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Hear, you children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For I give you good doctrine, forsake you not my law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For I was my fatherâ€™s son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">He taught me also, and said to me, Let your heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Forsake her not, and she shall preserve you: love her, and she shall keep you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all your getting get understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Exalt her, and she shall promote you: she shall bring you to honor, when you do embrace her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">She shall give to your head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of your life shall be many.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I have taught you in the way of wisdom; I have led you in right paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">When you go, your steps shall not be straitened; and when you run, you shall not stumble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is your life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shines more and more to the perfect day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">My son, attend to my words; incline your ear to my sayings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Let them not depart from your eyes; keep them in the middle of your heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For they are life to those that find them, and health to all their flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Keep your heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Put away from you a fraudulent mouth, and perverse lips put far from you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Let your eyes look right on, and let your eyelids look straight before you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Ponder the path of your feet, and let all your ways be established.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove your foot from evil.</p>
