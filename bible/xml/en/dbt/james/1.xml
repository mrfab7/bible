  <verse number="1">James, bondman of God and of [the] Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which [are] in the dispersion, greeting.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Count it all joy, my brethren, when ye fall into various temptations,</verse>
  <verse number="3">knowing that the proving of your faith works endurance.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But let endurance have [its] perfect work, that ye may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But if any one of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all freely and reproaches not, and it shall be given to him:</verse>
  <verse number="6">but let him ask in faith, nothing doubting. For he that doubts is like a wave of the sea driven by the wind and tossed about;</verse>
  <verse number="7">for let not that man think that he shall receive anything from the Lord;</verse>
  <verse number="8">[he is] a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But let the brother of low degree glory in his elevation,</verse>
  <verse number="10">and the rich in his humiliation, because as [the] grass’s flower he will pass away.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For the sun has risen with its burning heat, and has withered the grass, and its flower has fallen, and the comeliness of its look has perished: thus the rich also shall wither in his goings.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Blessed [is the] man who endures temptation; for, having been proved, he shall receive the crown of life, which He has promised to them that love him.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Let no man, being tempted, say, I am tempted of God. For God cannot be tempted by evil things, and himself tempts no one.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But every one is tempted, drawn away, and enticed by his own lust;</verse>
  <verse number="15">then lust, having conceived, gives birth to sin; but sin fully completed brings forth death.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Do not err, my beloved brethren.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Every good gift and every perfect gift comes down from above, from the Father of lights, with whom is no variation nor shadow of turning.</verse>
  <verse number="18">According to his own will begat he us by the word of truth, that we should be a certain first-fruits of his creatures.</verse>
  <verse number="19">So that, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath;</verse>
  <verse number="20">for man’s wrath does not work God’s righteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Wherefore, laying aside all filthiness and abounding of wickedness, accept with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But be ye doers of [the] word and not hearers only, beguiling yourselves.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For if any man be a hearer of [the] word and not a doer, he is like to a man considering his natural face in a mirror:</verse>
  <verse number="24">for he has considered himself and is gone away, and straightway he has forgotten what he was like.</verse>
  <verse number="25">But he that fixes his view on [the] perfect law, that of liberty, and abides in [it], being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of [the] work, he shall be blessed in his doing.</verse>
  <verse number="26">If any one think himself to be religious, not bridling his tongue, but deceiving his heart, this man’s religion is vain.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, to keep oneself unspotted from the world.</verse>
