<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us: consider, and behold our reproach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers [are] as widows.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Our necks [are] under persecution: we labour, [and] have no rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">We have given the hand [to] the Egyptians, [and to] the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Our fathers have sinned, [and are] not; and we have borne their iniquities.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Servants have ruled over us: [there is] none that doth deliver [us] out of their hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">We gat our bread with [the peril of] our lives because of the sword of the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">They ravished the women in Zion, [and] the maids in the cities of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not honoured.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their musick.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The crown is fallen [from] our head: woe unto us, that we have sinned!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For this our heart is faint; for these [things] our eyes are dim.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk upon it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation to generation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, [and] forsake us so long time?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us.</p>
