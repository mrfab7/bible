<p class="verse" data-verse="1">For the kingdom of the heavens is like a householder who went out with the early morn to hire workmen for his vineyard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And having agreed with the workmen for a denarius the day, he sent them into his vineyard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And having gone out about [the] third hour, he saw others standing in the market-place idle;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">and to them he said, Go also ye into the vineyard, and whatsoever may be just I will give you. And they went their way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Again, having gone out about the sixth and ninth hour, he did likewise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But about the eleventh [hour], having gone out, he found others standing, and says to them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">They say to him, Because no man has hired us. He says to them, Go also ye into the vineyard [and whatsoever may be just ye shall receive].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But when the evening was come, the lord of the vineyard says to his steward, Call the workmen and pay [them] their wages, beginning from the last even to the first.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And when they [who came to work] about the eleventh hour came, they received each a denarius.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more, and they received also themselves each a denarius.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And on receiving it they murmured against the master of the house,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">saying, These last have worked one hour, and thou hast made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the heat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But he answering said to one of them, [My] friend, I do not wrong thee. Didst thou not agree with me for a denarius?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Take what is thine and go. But it is my will to give to this last even as to thee:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">is it not lawful for me to do what I will in my own affairs? Is thine eye evil because I am good?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Thus shall the last be first, and the first last; for many are called ones, but few chosen ones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And Jesus, going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples with [him] apart in the way, and said to them,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be delivered up to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">and they will deliver him up to the nations to mock and to scourge and to crucify, and the third day he shall rise again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee, with her sons, doing homage, and asking something of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And he said to her, What wilt thou? She says to him, Speak [the word] that these my two sons may sit, one on thy right hand and one on thy left in thy kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Jesus answering said, Ye know not what ye ask. Can ye drink the cup which I am about to drink? They say to him, We are able.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">[And] he says to them, Ye shall drink indeed my cup, but to sit on my right hand and on [my] left, is not mine to give, but to those for whom it is prepared of my Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And the ten, having heard [of it], were indignant about the two brothers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">But Jesus having called them to [him], said, Ye know that the rulers of the nations exercise lordship over them, and the great exercise authority over them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">It shall not be thus amongst you, but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your servant;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">and whosoever will be first among you, let him be your bondman;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">as indeed the Son of man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And as they went out from Jericho a great crowd followed him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And lo, two blind men, sitting by the wayside, having heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out saying, Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">But the crowd rebuked them, that they might be silent. But they cried out the more, saying, Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And Jesus, having stopped, called them and said, What will ye that I shall do to you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">They say to him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and immediately their eyes had sight restored to them, and they followed him.</p>
