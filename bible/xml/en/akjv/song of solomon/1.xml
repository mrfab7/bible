<chapter book="Song of Solomon" number="1" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">The song of songs, which is Solomon’s.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for your love is better than wine.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Because of the smell of your good ointments your name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love you.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Draw me, we will run after you: the king has brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in you, we will remember your love more than wine: the upright love you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">I am black, but comely, O you daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Look not on me, because I am black, because the sun has looked on me: my mother’s children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but my own vineyard have I not kept.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Tell me, O you whom my soul loves, where you feed, where you make your flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turns aside by the flocks of your companions?</verse>
  <verse number="8">If you know not, O you fairest among women, go your way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed your kids beside the shepherds’ tents.</verse>
  <verse number="9">I have compared you, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh’s chariots.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Your cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, your neck with chains of gold.</verse>
  <verse number="11">We will make you borders of gold with studs of silver.</verse>
  <verse number="12">While the king sits at his table, my spikenard sends forth the smell thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="13">A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved to me; he shall lie all night between my breasts.</verse>
  <verse number="14">My beloved is to me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Behold, you are fair, my love; behold, you are fair; you have doves’ eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Behold, you are fair, my beloved, yes, pleasant: also our bed is green.</verse>
  <verse number="17">The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir.</verse>
