<p class="verse" data-verse="1">These things have I spoken to you, that you should not be offended.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">They shall put you out of the synagogues: yes, the time comes, that whoever kills you will think that he does God service.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And these things will they do to you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, you may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not to you at the beginning, because I was with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asks me, Where go you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send him to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Of sin, because they believe not on me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and you see me no more;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">However, when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things to come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall show it to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">All things that the Father has are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall show it to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">A little while, and you shall not see me: and again, a little while, and you shall see me, because I go to the Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he said to us, A little while, and you shall not see me: and again, a little while, and you shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">They said therefore, What is this that he said, A little while? we cannot tell what he said.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said to them, Do you inquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and you shall not see me: and again, a little while, and you shall see me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Truly, truly, I say to you, That you shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and you shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">A woman when she is in travail has sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembers no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And you now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man takes from you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And in that day you shall ask me nothing. Truly, truly, I say to you, Whatever you shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Till now have you asked nothing in my name: ask, and you shall receive, that your joy may be full.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">These things have I spoken to you in proverbs: but the time comes, when I shall no more speak to you in proverbs, but I shall show you plainly of the Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">At that day you shall ask in my name: and I say not to you, that I will pray the Father for you:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">His disciples said to him, See, now speak you plainly, and speak no proverb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Now are we sure that you know all things, and need not that any man should ask you: by this we believe that you came forth from God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Jesus answered them, Do you now believe?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Behold, the hour comes, yes, is now come, that you shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">These things I have spoken to you, that in me you might have peace. In the world you shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.</p>
