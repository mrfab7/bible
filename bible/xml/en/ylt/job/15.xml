  <verse number="1">And Eliphaz the Temanite answereth and saith:—</verse>
  <verse number="2">Doth a wise man answer with vain knowledge? And fill with an east wind his belly?</verse>
  <verse number="3">To reason with a word not useful? And speeches—no profit in them?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Yea, thou dost make reverence void, And dost diminish meditation before God.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For thy mouth teacheth thine iniquity, And thou chooseth the tongue of the subtile.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Thy mouth declareth thee wicked, and not I, And thy lips testify against thee.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The first man art thou born? And before the heights wast thou formed?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Of the secret counsel of God dost thou hear? And withdrawest thou unto thee wisdom?</verse>
  <verse number="9">What hast thou known, and we know not? Understandest thou—and it is not with us?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Both the gray-headed And the very aged are among us—Greater than thy father in days.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Too few for thee are the comforts of God? And a gentle word is with thee,</verse>
  <verse number="12">What—doth thine heart take thee away? And what—are thine eyes high?</verse>
  <verse number="13">For thou turnest against God thy spirit? And hast brought out words from thy mouth:</verse>
  <verse number="14">What is man that he is pure, And that he is righteous, one born of woman?</verse>
  <verse number="15">Lo, in His holy ones He putteth no credence, And the heavens have not been pure in His eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Also—surely abominable and filthy Is man drinking as water perverseness.</verse>
  <verse number="17">I shew thee—hearken to me—And this I have seen and declare:</verse>
  <verse number="18">Which the wise declare—And have not hid—from their fathers.</verse>
  <verse number="19">To them alone was the land given, And a stranger passed not over into their midst:</verse>
  <verse number="20">‘All days of the wicked he is paining himself, And few years have been laid up for the terrible one.</verse>
  <verse number="21">A fearful voice is in his ears, In peace doth a destroyer come to him.</verse>
  <verse number="22">He believeth not to return from darkness, And watched is he for the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="23">He is wandering for bread—‘Where is it?’ He hath known that ready at his hand Is a day of darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Terrify him do adversity and distress, They prevail over him As a king ready for a boaster.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For he stretched out against God his hand, And against the Mighty he maketh himself mighty.</verse>
  <verse number="26">He runneth unto Him with a neck, With thick bosses of his shields.</verse>
  <verse number="27">For he hath covered his face with his fat, And maketh vigour over his confidence.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And he inhabiteth cities cut off, houses not dwelt in, That have been ready to become heaps.</verse>
  <verse number="29">He is not rich, nor doth his wealth rise, Nor doth he stretch out on earth their continuance.</verse>
  <verse number="30">He turneth not aside from darkness, His tender branch doth a flame dry up, And he turneth aside at the breath of His mouth!</verse>
  <verse number="31">Let him not put credence in vanity, He hath been deceived, For vanity is his recompence.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Not in his day is it completed, And his bending branch is not green.</verse>
  <verse number="33">He shaketh off as a vine his unripe fruit, And casteth off as an olive his blossom.</verse>
  <verse number="34">For the company of the profane is gloomy, And fire hath consumed tents of bribery.</verse>
  <verse number="35">To conceive misery, and to bear iniquity, Even their heart doth prepare deceit.</verse>
