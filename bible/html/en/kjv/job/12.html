<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Job answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">No doubt but ye [are] the people, and wisdom shall die with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">But I have understanding as well as you; I [am] not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I am [as] one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright [man is] laughed to scorn.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He that is ready to slip with [his] feet [is as] a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth [abundantly].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">In whose hand [is] the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">With the ancient [is] wisdom; and in length of days understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">With him [is] wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">With him [is] strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver [are] his.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He leadeth counsellers away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them [again].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness [where there is] no way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like [a] drunken [man].</p>
