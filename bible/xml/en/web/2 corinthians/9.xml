<chapter book="2 Corinthians" number="9" translation="World English Bible" translationID="web" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">It is indeed unnecessary for me to write to you concerning the service to the saints,</verse>
  <verse number="2">for I know your readiness, of which I boast on your behalf to them of Macedonia, that Achaia has been prepared for a year past. Your zeal has stirred up very many of them.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But I have sent the brothers that our boasting on your behalf may not be in vain in this respect, that, just as I said, you may be prepared,</verse>
  <verse number="4">so that I won’t by any means, if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared, we (to say nothing of you) should be disappointed in this confident boasting.</verse>
  <verse number="5">I thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brothers that they would go before to you, and arrange ahead of time the generous gift that you promised before, that the same might be ready as a matter of generosity, and not of greediness.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Remember this: he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly. He who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Let each man give according as he has determined in his heart; not grudgingly, or under compulsion; for God loves a cheerful giver.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And God is able to make all grace abound to you, that you, always having all sufficiency in everything, may abound to every good work.</verse>
  <verse number="9">As it is written, “He has scattered abroad, he has given to the poor. His righteousness remains forever.”</verse>
  <verse number="10">Now may he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food, supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;</verse>
  <verse number="11">you being enriched in everything to all liberality, which works through us thanksgiving to God.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For this service of giving that you perform not only makes up for lack among the saints, but abounds also through many givings of thanks to God;</verse>
  <verse number="13">seeing that through the proof given by this service, they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the Good News of Christ, and for the liberality of your contribution to them and to all;</verse>
  <verse number="14">while they themselves also, with supplication on your behalf, yearn for you by reason of the exceeding grace of God in you.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Now thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift!</verse>
