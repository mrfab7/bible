1	Chorus to Bride: Where has your beloved gone, O most beautiful among women? To where has your beloved turned aside, so that we may seek him with you?
2	Bride: My beloved has descended to his garden, to the courtyard of aromatic plants, in order to pasture in the gardens and gather the lilies.
3	I am for my beloved, and my beloved is for me. He pastures among the lilies.
4	Groom to Bride: My love, you are beautiful: sweet and graceful, like Jerusalem; terrible, like an army in battle array.
5	Avert your eyes from me, for they have caused me fly away. Your hair is like a flock of goats, which have appeared out of Gilead.
6	Your teeth are like a flock of sheep, which have ascended from the washing, each one with its identical twin, and not one among them is barren.
7	Like the skin of a pomegranate, so are your cheeks, except for your hiddenness.
8	There are sixty queens, and eighty concubines, and maidens without number.
9	One is my dove, my perfect one. One is her mother; elect is she who bore her. The daughters saw her, and they proclaimed her most blessed. The queens and concubines saw her, and they praised her.
10	Chorus to Groom: Who is she, who advances like the rising dawn, as beautiful as the moon, as elect as the sun, as terrible as an army in battle array?
11	Bride: I descended to the garden of nuts, in order to see the fruits of the steep valleys, and to examine whether the vineyard had flourished and the pomegranates had produced buds.
12	I did not understand. My soul was stirred up within me because of the chariots of Amminadab.
13	Chorus to Bride: Return, return, O Sulamitess. Return, return, so that we may consider you.
