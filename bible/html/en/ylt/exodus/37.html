<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and he overlayeth it with pure gold within and without, and maketh for it a wreath of gold round about;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and he casteth for it four rings of gold, on its four feet, even two rings on its one side, and two rings on its second side;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">and he maketh staves of shittim wood, and overlayeth them with gold,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">and he bringeth in the staves into the rings, by the sides of the ark, to bear the ark.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And he maketh a mercy-seat of pure gold, two cubits and a half its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth;</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="8">one cherub at the end on this side, and one cherub at the end on that, out of the mercy-seat he hath made the cherubs, at its two ends;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">and the cherubs are spreading out wings on high, covering over the mercy-seat with their wings, and their faces are one towards another; towards the mercy-seat have the faces of the cherubs been.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="11">and overlayeth it with pure gold, and maketh for it a wreath of gold round about.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And he maketh for it a border of a handbreadth round about, and maketh a wreath of gold for its border round about;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">and he casteth for it four rings of gold, and putteth the rings on the four corners which are to its four feet;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">over-against the border have the rings been, places for staves to bear the table.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And he maketh the staves of shittim wood, and overlayeth them with gold, to bear the table;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">and he maketh the vessels which are upon the table, its dishes, and its bowls, and its cups, and the cups by which they pour out, of pure gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And he maketh the candlestick of pure gold; of beaten work he hath made the candlestick, its base, and its branch, its calyxes, its knops, and its flowers, have been of the same;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">and six branches are coming out of its sides, three branches of the candlestick out of its one side, and three branches of the candlestick out of its second side;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">three calyxes, made like almonds, in the one branch, a knop and a flower; and three calyxes, made like almonds, in another branch, a knop and a flower; so to the six branches which are coming out of the candlestick.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And in the candlestick are four calyxes, made like almonds, its knops, and its flowers,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">and a knop under the two branches of the same, and a knop under the two branches of the same, and a knop under the two branches of the same, are to the six branches which are coming out of it;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">their knops and their branches have been of the same; all of it one beaten work of pure gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And he maketh its seven lamps, and its snuffers, and its snuff-dishes, of pure gold;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">of a talent of pure gold he hath made it, and all its vessels.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And he maketh the perfume-altar of shittim wood; a cubit its length, and a cubit its breadth (square), and two cubits its height; its horns have been of the same;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">and he overlayeth it with pure gold, its top and its sides round about, and its horns; and he maketh for it a wreath of gold round about;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">and two rings of gold he hath made for it under its wreath, at its two corners, at its two sides, for places for staves to bear it with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And he maketh the staves of shittim wood, and overlayeth them with gold;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">and he maketh the holy anointing oil, and the pure spice-perfumeâ€”work of a compounder.</p>
