<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then some Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“Why do Your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They do not wash their hands before they eat.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Jesus replied, “And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For God said, ‘Honor your father and mother’ and ‘Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But you say that if anyone says to his father or mother, ‘Whatever you would have received from me is a gift devoted to God,’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">he need not honor his father or mother with it. Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">You hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">‘These people honor Me with their lips, but their hearts are far from Me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">They worship Me in vain; they teach as doctrine the precepts of men.’”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Jesus called the crowd to Him and said, “Listen and understand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">A man is not defiled by what enters his mouth, but by what comes out of it.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Then the disciples came to Him and said, “Are You aware that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But Jesus replied, “Every plant that My heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by its roots.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Disregard them! They are blind guides. If a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Peter said to Him, “Explain this parable to us.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">“Do you still not understand?” Jesus asked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">“Do you not yet realize that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then is eliminated?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these things defile a man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, and slander.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">These are what defile a man, but eating with unwashed hands does not defile him.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And a Canaanite woman from that region came to Him, crying out, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is miserably possessed by a demon.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">But Jesus did not answer a word. So His disciples came and urged Him, “Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The woman came and knelt before Him. “Lord, help me!” she said.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">But Jesus replied, “It is not right to take the children’s bread and toss it to the dogs.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">“Yes, Lord,” she said, “even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master’s table.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">“O woman,” Jesus answered, “your faith is great! Let it be done for you as you desire.” And her daughter was healed from that very hour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Moving on from there, Jesus went along the Sea of Galilee. Then He went up on a mountain and sat down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Large crowds came to Him, bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others, and laid them at His feet, and He healed them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">The crowd was amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled restored, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Then Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, “I have compassion for this crowd, because they have already been with Me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may faint along the way.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">The disciples replied, “Where in this desolate place could we find enough bread to feed such a large crowd?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">“How many loaves do you have?” Jesus asked. “Seven,” they replied, “and a few small fish.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And He instructed the crowd to sit down on the ground.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Taking the seven loaves and the fish, He gave thanks and broke them. Then He gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">A total of four thousand men were fed, besides women and children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">After Jesus had dismissed the crowds, He got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.</p>
