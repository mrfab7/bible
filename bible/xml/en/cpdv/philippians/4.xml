<chapter book="Philippians" number="4" translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" translationID="cpdv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And so, my most beloved and most desired brothers, my joy and my crown: stand firm in this way, in the Lord, most beloved.</verse>
  <verse number="2">I ask Euodia, and I beg Syntyche, to have the same understanding in the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And I also ask you, as my genuine companion, to assist those women who have labored with me in the Gospel, with Clement and the rest of my assistants, whose names are in the Book of Life.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Rejoice in the Lord always. Again, I say, rejoice.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Let your modesty be known to all men. The Lord is near.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Be anxious about nothing. But in all things, with prayer and supplication, with acts of thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to God.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And so shall the peace of God, which exceeds all understanding, guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Concerning the rest, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is chaste, whatever is just, whatever is holy, whatever is worthy to be loved, whatever is of good repute, if there is any virtue, if there is any praiseworthy discipline: meditate on these.</verse>
  <verse number="9">All the things that you have learned and accepted and heard and seen in me, do these. And so shall the God of peace be with you.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Now I rejoice in the Lord exceedingly, because finally, after some time, your feelings for me have flourished again, just as you formerly felt. For you had been preoccupied.</verse>
  <verse number="11">I am not saying this as if out of need. For I have learned that, in whatever state I am, it is sufficient.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I know how to be humbled, and I know how to abound. I am prepared for anything, anywhere: either to be full or to be hungry, either to have abundance or to endure scarcity.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Everything is possible in him who has strengthened me.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Yet truly, you have done well by sharing in my tribulation.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But you also know, O Philippians, that at the beginning of the Gospel, when I set out from Macedonia, not a single church shared with me in the plan of giving and receiving, except you alone.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For you even sent to Thessalonica, once, and then a second time, for what was useful to me.</verse>
  <verse number="17">It is not that I am seeking a gift. Instead, I seek the fruit that abounds to your benefit.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But I have everything in abundance. I have been filled up, having received from Epaphroditus the things that you sent; this is an odor of sweetness, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And may my God fulfill all your desires, according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And to God our Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Greet every saint in Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="22">The brothers who are with me greet you. All the saints greet you, but especially those who are of Caesar’s household.</verse>
  <verse number="23">May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</verse>
