<div class="chapter" data-book="Micah" data-chapter="2" data-translation="World English Bible" data-translation-id="web" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Woe to those who devise iniquity and work evil on their beds! When the morning is light, they practice it, because it is in the power of their hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">They covet fields, and seize them; and houses, and take them away: and they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Therefore thus says Yahweh: “Behold, I am planning against these people a disaster, from which you will not remove your necks, neither will you walk haughtily; for it is an evil time.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">In that day they will take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, saying, ‘We are utterly ruined! My people’s possession is divided up. Indeed he takes it from me and assigns our fields to traitors!’”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Therefore you will have no one who divides the land by lot in the assembly of Yahweh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">“Don’t prophesy!” They prophesy. “Don’t prophesy about these things. Disgrace won’t overtake us.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Shall it be said, O house of Jacob: “Is the Spirit of Yahweh angry? Are these his doings? Don’t my words do good to him who walks blamelessly?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But lately my people have risen up as an enemy. You strip the robe and clothing from those who pass by without a care, returning from battle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">You drive the women of my people out from their pleasant houses; from their young children you take away my blessing forever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Arise, and depart! For this is not your resting place, because of uncleanness that destroys, even with a grievous destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">If a man walking in a spirit of falsehood lies: “I will prophesy to you of wine and of strong drink;” he would be the prophet of this people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I will surely assemble, Jacob, all of you; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as a flock in the midst of their pasture; they will swarm with people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He who breaks open the way goes up before them. They break through the gate, and go out. And their king passes on before them, with Yahweh at their head.</p>
