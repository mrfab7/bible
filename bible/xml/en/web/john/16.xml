  <verse number="1">“These things have I spoken to you, so that you wouldn’t be caused to stumble.</verse>
  <verse number="2">They will put you out of the synagogues. Yes, the time comes that whoever kills you will think that he offers service to God.</verse>
  <verse number="3">They will do these things because they have not known the Father, nor me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But I have told you these things, so that when the time comes, you may remember that I told you about them. I didn’t tell you these things from the beginning, because I was with you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But now I am going to him who sent me, and none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’</verse>
  <verse number="6">But because I have told you these things, sorrow has filled your heart.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is to your advantage that I go away, for if I don’t go away, the Counselor won’t come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you.</verse>
  <verse number="8">When he has come, he will convict the world about sin, about righteousness, and about judgment;</verse>
  <verse number="9">about sin, because they don’t believe in me;</verse>
  <verse number="10">about righteousness, because I am going to my Father, and you won’t see me any more;</verse>
  <verse number="11">about judgment, because the prince of this world has been judged.</verse>
  <verse number="12">“I have yet many things to tell you, but you can’t bear them now.</verse>
  <verse number="13">However when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he will guide you into all truth, for he will not speak from himself; but whatever he hears, he will speak. He will declare to you things that are coming.</verse>
  <verse number="14">He will glorify me, for he will take from what is mine, and will declare it to you.</verse>
  <verse number="15">All things whatever the Father has are mine; therefore I said that he takes of mine, and will declare it to you.</verse>
  <verse number="16">A little while, and you will not see me. Again a little while, and you will see me.”</verse>
  <verse number="17">Some of his disciples therefore said to one another, “What is this that he says to us, ‘A little while, and you won’t see me, and again a little while, and you will see me;’ and, ‘Because I go to the Father?’”</verse>
  <verse number="18">They said therefore, “What is this that he says, ‘A little while?’ We don’t know what he is saying.”</verse>
  <verse number="19">Therefore Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask him, and he said to them, “Do you inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said, ‘A little while, and you won’t see me, and again a little while, and you will see me?’</verse>
  <verse number="20">Most certainly I tell you, that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.</verse>
  <verse number="21">A woman, when she gives birth, has sorrow, because her time has come. But when she has delivered the child, she doesn’t remember the anguish any more, for the joy that a human being is born into the world.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Therefore you now have sorrow, but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you.</verse>
  <verse number="23">“In that day you will ask me no questions. Most certainly I tell you, whatever you may ask of the Father in my name, he will give it to you.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Until now, you have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be made full.</verse>
  <verse number="25">I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech. But the time is coming when I will no more speak to you in figures of speech, but will tell you plainly about the Father.</verse>
  <verse number="26">In that day you will ask in my name; and I don’t say to you, that I will pray to the Father for you,</verse>
  <verse number="27">for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from God.</verse>
  <verse number="28">I came out from the Father, and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.”</verse>
  <verse number="29">His disciples said to him, “Behold, now you speak plainly, and speak no figures of speech.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Now we know that you know all things, and don’t need for anyone to question you. By this we believe that you came forth from God.”</verse>
  <verse number="31">Jesus answered them, “Do you now believe?</verse>
  <verse number="32">Behold, the time is coming, yes, and has now come, that you will be scattered, everyone to his own place, and you will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</verse>
  <verse number="33">I have told you these things, that in me you may have peace. In the world you have oppression; but cheer up! I have overcome the world.”</verse>
