<div class="chapter" data-book="Hebrews" data-chapter="13" data-translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" data-translation-id="drb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Let the charity of the brotherhood abide in you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And hospitality do not forget; for by this some, being not aware of it, have entertained angels.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Remember them that are in bands, as if you were bound with them; and them that labour, as being yourselves also in the body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Marriage honourable in all, and the bed undefiled. For fornicators and adulterers God will judge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Let your manners be without covetousness, contented with such things as you have; for he hath said: I will not leave thee, neither will I forsake thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">So that we may confidently say: The Lord is my helper: I will not fear what man shall do to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Remember your prelates who have spoken the word of God to you; whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Jesus Christ, yesterday, and to day; and the same for ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Be not led away with various and strange doctrines. For it is best that the heart be established with grace, not with meats; which have not profited those that walk in them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">We have an altar, whereof they have no power to eat who serve the tabernacle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the holies by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people by his own blood, suffered without the gate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Let us go forth therefore to him without the camp, bearing his reproach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For we have not here a lasting city, but we seek one that is to come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise always to God, that is to say, the fruit of lips confessing to his name.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And do not forget to do good, and to impart; for by such sacrifices Godâ€™s favour is obtained.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Obey your prelates, and be subject to them. For they watch as being to render an account of your souls; that they may do this with joy, and not with grief. For this is not expedient for you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Pray for us. For we trust we have a good conscience, being willing to behave ourselves well in all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And I beseech you the more to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And may the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great pastor of the sheep, our Lord Jesus Christ, in the blood of the everlasting testament,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Fit you in all goodness, that you may do his will; doing in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom is glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And I beseech you, brethren, that you suffer this word of consolation. For I have written to you in a few words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty: with whom (if he come shortly) I will see you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Salute all your prelates, and all the saints. The brethren from Italy salute you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Grace be with you all. Amen.</p>
