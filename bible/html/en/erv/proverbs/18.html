<p class="verse" data-verse="1">He that separateth himself seeketh his own desire, and rageth against all sound wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">A fool hath no delight in understanding, but only that his heart may reveal itself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">When the wicked cometh, there cometh also contempt, and with ignominy cometh reproach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The words of a man’s mouth are as deep waters; the wellspring of wisdom is as a flowing brook.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">To accept the person of the wicked is not good, nor to turn aside the righteous in judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">A fool’s lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for stripes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">A fool’s mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The words of a whisperer are as dainty, morsels, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He also that is slack in his work is brother to him that is a destroyer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The rich man’s wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in his own imagination.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour goeth humility.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He that giveth answer before he heareth, it is folly and shame unto him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a broken spirit who can bear?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">A man’s gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He that pleadeth his cause first seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and such contentions are like the bars of a castle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">A man’s belly shall be filled with the fruit of his mouth; with the increase of his lips shall he be satisfied.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Death and life are in the power of the tongue; and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The poor useth entreaties: but the rich answereth roughly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He that maketh many friends doeth it to his own destruction: but there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.</p>
