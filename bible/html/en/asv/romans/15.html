<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now we that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Let each one of us please his neighbor for that which is good, unto edifying.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For Christ also pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell upon me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that through patience and through comfort of the scriptures we might have hope.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Now the God of patience and of comfort grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to Christ Jesus:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">that with one accord ye may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Wherefore receive ye one another, even as Christ also received you, to the glory of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For I say that Christ hath been made a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, that he might confirm the promises given unto the fathers,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, Therefore will I give praise unto thee among the Gentiles, And sing unto thy name.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; And let all the peoples praise him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And again, Isaiah saith, There shall be the root of Jesse, And he that ariseth to rule over the Gentiles; On him shall the Gentiles hope.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, in the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But I write the more boldly unto you in some measure, as putting you again in remembrance, because of the grace that was given me of God,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">that I should be a minister of Christ Jesus unto the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I have therefore my glorying in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For I will not dare to speak of any things save those which Christ wrought through me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Spirit; so that from Jerusalem, and round about even unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">yea, making it my aim so to preach the gospel, not where Christ was already named, that I might not build upon another man’s foundation;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">but, as it is written, They shall see, to whom no tidings of him came, And they who have not heard shall understand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Wherefore also I was hindered these many times from coming to you:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">but now, having no more any place in these regions, and having these many years a longing to come unto you,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">whensoever I go unto Spain (for I hope to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first in some measure I shall have been satisfied with your company)—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">but now, I say, I go unto Jerusalem, ministering unto the saints.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For it hath been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints that are at Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Yea, it hath been their good pleasure; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they owe it to them also to minister unto them in carnal things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">When therefore I have accomplished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by you unto Spain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And I know that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Now I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">that I may be delivered from them that are disobedient in Judæa, and that my ministration which I have for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">that I may come unto you in joy through the will of God, and together with you find rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.</p>
