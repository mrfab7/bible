  <verse number="1">Now Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the LORD said to him, You are old and stricken in years, and there remains yet very much land to be possessed.</verse>
  <verse number="2">This is the land that yet remains: all the borders of the Philistines, and all Geshuri,</verse>
  <verse number="3">From Sihor, which is before Egypt, even to the borders of Ekron northward, which is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites:</verse>
  <verse number="4">From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that is beside the Sidonians to Aphek, to the borders of the Amorites:</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the sun rise, from Baalgad under mount Hermon to the entering into Hamath.</verse>
  <verse number="6">All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephothmaim, and all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: only divide you it by lot to the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded you.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh,</verse>
  <verse number="8">With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them;</verse>
  <verse number="9">From Aroer, that is on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the river, and all the plain of Medeba to Dibon;</verse>
  <verse number="10">And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, to the border of the children of Ammon;</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan to Salcah;</verse>
  <verse number="12">All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants: for these did Moses smite, and cast them out.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites, nor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Only to the tribes of Levi he gave none inheritance; the sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire are their inheritance, as he said to them.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Moses gave to the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance according to their families.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the river, and all the plain by Medeba;</verse>
  <verse number="17">Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon,</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Jahaza, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,</verse>
  <verse number="19">And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zarethshahar in the mount of the valley,</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Bethpeor, and Ashdothpisgah, and Bethjeshimoth,</verse>
  <verse number="21">And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, which were dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the country.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the border thereof. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their families, the cities and the villages thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And Moses gave inheritance to the tribe of Gad, even to the children of Gad according to their families.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, to Aroer that is before Rabbah;</verse>
  <verse number="26">And from Heshbon to Ramathmizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir;</verse>
  <verse number="27">And in the valley, Betharam, and Bethnimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and his border, even to the edge of the sea of Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward.</verse>
  <verse number="28">This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their families, the cities, and their villages.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And Moses gave inheritance to the half tribe of Manasseh: and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, three score cities:</verse>
  <verse number="31">And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were pertaining to the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, even to the one half of the children of Machir by their families.</verse>
  <verse number="32">These are the countries which Moses did distribute for inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan, by Jericho, eastward.</verse>
  <verse number="33">But to the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the LORD God of Israel was their inheritance, as he said to them.</verse>
