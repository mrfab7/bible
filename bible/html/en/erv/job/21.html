<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hear diligently my speech; and let this be your consolations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Suffer me, and I also will speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">As for me, is my complaint to man? and why should I not be impatient?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Even when I remember I am troubled, and horror taketh hold on my flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, wax mighty in power?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Their seed is established with them in their sight, and their offspring before their eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">They sing to the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the pipe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They spend their days in prosperity, and in a moment they go down to Sheol.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Yet they said unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Lo, their prosperity is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">How oft is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out? that their calamity cometh upon them? that God distributeth sorrows in his anger?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">That they are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Ye say, God layeth up his iniquity for his children. Let him recompense it unto himself, that he may know it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Let his own eyes see his destruction, and let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">His breasts are full of milk, and the marrow of his bones is moistened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And another dieth in bitterness of soul, and never tasteth of good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">They lie down alike in the dust, and the worm covereth them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where is the tent wherein the wicked dwelt?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">That the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity? that they are led forth to the day of wrath?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Yet shall he be borne to the grave, and shall keep watch over the tomb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and all men shall draw after him, as there were innumerable before him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth only falsehood?</p>
