  <verse number="1">And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of them rods, one for each fathers’ house, of all their princes according to their fathers’ houses, twelve rods: write thou every man’s name upon his rod.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And thou shalt write Aaron’s name upon the rod of Levi; for there shall be one rod for each head of their fathers’ houses.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And thou shalt lay them up in the tent of meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And it shall come to pass, that the rod of the man whom I shall choose shall bud: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against you.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Moses spake unto the children of Israel; and all their princes gave him rods, for each prince one, according to their fathers’ houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And Moses laid up the rods before Jehovah in the tent of the testimony.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and put forth buds, and produced blossoms, and bare ripe almonds.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Moses brought out all the rods from before Jehovah unto all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Jehovah said unto Moses, Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the children of rebellion; that thou mayest make an end of their murmurings against me, that they die not.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Thus did Moses: as Jehovah commanded him, so did he.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we perish, we are undone, we are all undone.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Every one that cometh near, that cometh near unto the tabernacle of Jehovah, dieth: shall we perish all of us?</verse>
