<p class="verse" data-verse="1">At that time the LORD said to me, Hew you two tables of stone like to the first, and come up to me into the mount, and make you an ark of wood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which you brake, and you shall put them in the ark.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like to the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in my hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spoke to you in the mount out of the middle of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest’s office in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">From there they journeyed to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Why Levi has no part nor inheritance with his brothers; the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD your God promised him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the LORD listened to me at that time also, and the LORD would not destroy you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And the LORD said to me, Arise, take your journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I swore to their fathers to give to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require of you, but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command you this day for your good?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD’s your God, the earth also, with all that therein is.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Only the LORD had a delight in your fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff necked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regards not persons, nor takes reward:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He does execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loves the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Love you therefore the stranger: for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">You shall fear the LORD your God; him shall you serve, and to him shall you hold, and swear by his name.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He is your praise, and he is your God, that has done for you these great and terrible things, which your eyes have seen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Your fathers went down into Egypt with three score and ten persons; and now the LORD your God has made you as the stars of heaven for multitude.</p>
