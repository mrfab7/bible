  <verse number="1">And after six days Jesus takes Peter, James, and John his brother, and brings them up into an high mountain apart,</verse>
  <verse number="2">And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And, behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elias talking with him.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Then answered Peter, and said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if you will, let us make here three tabernacles; one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.</verse>
  <verse number="5">While he yet spoke, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear you him.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Jesus answered and said to them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But I say to you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done to him whatever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptist.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,</verse>
  <verse number="15">Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatic, and sore vexed: for often he falls into the fire, and oft into the water.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And I brought him to your disciples, and they could not cure him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him here to me.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Jesus said to them, Because of your unbelief: for truly I say to you, If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible to you.</verse>
  <verse number="21">However, this kind goes not out but by prayer and fasting.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And while they stayed in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:</verse>
  <verse number="23">And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceeding sorry.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, Does not your master pay tribute?</verse>
  <verse number="25">He said, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What think you, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?</verse>
  <verse number="26">Peter said to him, Of strangers. Jesus said to him, Then are the children free.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go you to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first comes up; and when you have opened his mouth, you shall find a piece of money: that take, and give to them for me and you.</verse>
