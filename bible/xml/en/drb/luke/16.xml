  <verse number="1">AND he said also to his disciples: There was a certain rich man who had a steward: and the same was accused unto him, that he had wasted his goods.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he called him, and said to him: How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship: for now thou canst be steward no longer.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the steward said within himself: What shall I do, because my lord taketh away from me the stewardship? To dig I am not able; to beg I am ashamed.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I know what I will do, that when I shall be removed from the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Therefore calling together every one of his lord’s debtors, he said to the first: How much dost thou owe my lord?</verse>
  <verse number="6">But he said: An hundred barrels of oil. And he said to him: Take thy bill and sit down quickly, and write fifty.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Then he said to another: And how much dost thou owe? Who said: An hundred quarters of wheat. He said to him: Take thy bill, and write eighty.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the lord commended the unjust steward, forasmuch as he had done wisely: for the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And I say to you: Make unto you friends of the mammon of iniquity; that when you shall fail, they may receive you into everlasting dwellings.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He that is faithful in that which is least, is faithful also in that which is greater: and he that is unjust in that which is little, is unjust also in that which is greater.</verse>
  <verse number="11">If then you have not been faithful in the unjust mammon; who will trust you with that which is the true?</verse>
  <verse number="12">And if you have not been faithful in that which is another’s; who will give you that which is your own?</verse>
  <verse number="13">No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or he will hold to the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Now the Pharisees, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And he said to them: You are they who justify yourselves before men, but God knoweth your hearts; for that which is high to men, is an abomination before God.</verse>
  <verse number="16">The law and the prophets were until John; from that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every one useth violence towards it.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fall.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Every one that putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth her that is put away from her husband, commmitteth adultery.</verse>
  <verse number="19">There was a certain rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen; and feasted sumptuously every day.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And there was a certain beggar, named Lazarus, who lay at his gate, full of sores,</verse>
  <verse number="21">Desiring to be filled with the crumbs that fell from the rich man’s table, and no one did give him; moreover the dogs came, and licked his sores.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham’s bosom. And the rich man also died: and he was buried in hell.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And lifting up his eyes when he was in torments, he saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom:</verse>
  <verse number="24">And he cried, and said: Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, to cool my tongue: for I am tormented in this flame.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And Abraham said to him: Son, remember that thou didst receive good things in thy lifetime, and likewise Lazareth evil things, but now he is comforted; and thou art tormented.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And besides all this, between us and you, there is fixed a great chaos: so that they who would pass from hence to you, cannot, nor from thence come hither.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And he said: Then, father, I beseech thee, that thou wouldst send him to my father’s house, for I have five brethren,</verse>
  <verse number="28">That he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torments.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And Abraham said to him: They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.</verse>
  <verse number="30">But he said: No, father Abraham: but if one went to them from the dead, they will do penance.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And he said to him: If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they believe, if one rise again from the dead.</verse>
