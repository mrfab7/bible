  <verse number="1">‘These things I have spoken to you, that ye may not be stumbled,</verse>
  <verse number="2">out of the synagogues they will put you; but an hour doth come, that every one who hath killed you, may think to offer service unto God;</verse>
  <verse number="3">and these things they will do to you, because they did not know the Father, nor me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But these things I have spoken to you, that when the hour may come, ye may remember them, that I said them to you, and these things to you from the beginning I did not say, because I was with you;</verse>
  <verse number="5">and now I go away to Him who sent me, and none of you doth ask me, Whither dost thou go?</verse>
  <verse number="6">but because these things I have said to you, the sorrow hath filled your heart.</verse>
  <verse number="7">‘But I tell you the truth; it is better for you that I go away, for if I may not go away, the Comforter will not come unto you, and if I go on, I will send Him unto you;</verse>
  <verse number="8">and having come, He will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment;</verse>
  <verse number="9">concerning sin indeed, because they do not believe in me;</verse>
  <verse number="10">and concerning righteousness, because unto my Father I go away, and no more do ye behold me;</verse>
  <verse number="11">and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world hath been judged.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I have yet many things to say to you, but ye are not able to bear them now;</verse>
  <verse number="13">and when He may come—the Spirit of truth—He will guide you to all the truth, for He will not speak from Himself, but as many things as He will hear He will speak, and the coming things He will tell you;</verse>
  <verse number="14">He will glorify me, because of mine He will take, and will tell to you.</verse>
  <verse number="15">‘All things, as many as the Father hath, are mine; because of this I said, That of mine He will take, and will tell to you;</verse>
  <verse number="16">a little while, and ye do not behold me, and again a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go away unto the Father.’</verse>
  <verse number="17">Therefore said some of his disciples one to another, ‘What is this that he saith to us, A little while, and ye do not behold me, and again a little while, and ye shall see me, and, Because I go away unto the Father?’</verse>
  <verse number="18">they said then, ‘What is this he saith—the little while? we have not known what he saith.’</verse>
  <verse number="19">Jesus, therefore, knew that they were wishing to ask him, and he said to them, ‘Concerning this do ye seek one with another, because I said, A little while, and you do not behold me, and again a little while, and ye shall see me?</verse>
  <verse number="20">verily, verily, I say to you, that ye shall weep and lament, and the world will rejoice; and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow joy will become.</verse>
  <verse number="21">‘The woman, when she may bear, hath sorrow, because her hour did come, and when she may bear the child, no more doth she remember the anguish, because of the joy that a man was born to the world.</verse>
  <verse number="22">‘And ye, therefore, now, indeed, have sorrow; and again I will see you, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one doth take from you,</verse>
  <verse number="23">and in that day ye will question me nothing; verily, verily, I say to you, as many things as ye may ask of the Father in my name, He will give you;</verse>
  <verse number="24">till now ye did ask nothing in my name; ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.</verse>
  <verse number="25">‘These things in similitudes I have spoken to you, but there cometh an hour when no more in similitudes will I speak to you, but freely of the Father, will tell you.</verse>
  <verse number="26">‘In that day, in my name ye will make request, and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father for you,</verse>
  <verse number="27">for the Father himself doth love you, because me ye have loved, and ye have believed that I from God came forth;</verse>
  <verse number="28">I came forth from the Father, and have come to the world; again I leave the world, and go on unto the Father.’</verse>
  <verse number="29">His disciples say to him, ‘Lo, now freely thou dost speak, and no similitude speakest thou;</verse>
  <verse number="30">now we have known that thou hast known all things, and hast no need that any one do question thee; in this we believe that from God thou didst come forth.’</verse>
  <verse number="31">Jesus answered them, ‘Now do ye believe? lo, there doth come an hour,</verse>
  <verse number="32">and now it hath come, that ye may be scattered, each to his own things, and me ye may leave alone, and I am not alone, because the Father is with me;</verse>
  <verse number="33">these things I have spoken to you, that in me ye may have peace, in the world ye shall have tribulation, but take courage—I have overcome the world.’</verse>
