1	For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.
2	For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.
3	But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.
4	For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.
5	Why when he comes into the world, he said, Sacrifice and offering you would not, but a body have you prepared me:
6	In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you have had no pleasure.
7	Then said I, See, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do your will, O God.
8	Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin you would not, neither had pleasure therein; which are offered by the law;
9	Then said he, See, I come to do your will, O God. He takes away the first, that he may establish the second.
10	By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
11	And every priest stands daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:
12	But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;
13	From now on expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.
14	For by one offering he has perfected for ever them that are sanctified.
15	Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,
16	This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, said the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;
17	And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.
18	Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.
19	Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,
20	By a new and living way, which he has consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;
21	And having an high priest over the house of God;
22	Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.
23	Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)
24	And let us consider one another to provoke to love and to good works:
25	Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as you see the day approaching.
26	For if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins,
27	But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.
28	He that despised Moses’ law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:
29	Of how much sorer punishment, suppose you, shall he be thought worthy, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant, with which he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and has done despite to the Spirit of grace?
30	For we know him that has said, Vengeance belongs to me, I will recompense, said the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.
31	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
32	But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after you were illuminated, you endured a great fight of afflictions;
33	Partly, whilst you were made a spectacle both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst you became companions of them that were so used.
34	For you had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that you have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.
35	Cast not away therefore your confidence, which has great recompense of reward.
36	For you have need of patience, that, after you have done the will of God, you might receive the promise.
37	For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.
38	Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.
39	But we are not of them who draw back to perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.
