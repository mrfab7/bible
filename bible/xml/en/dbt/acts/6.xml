  <verse number="1">But in those days, the disciples multiplying in number, there arose a murmuring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews because their widows were overlooked in the daily ministration.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the twelve, having called the multitude of the disciples to [them], said, It is not right that we, leaving the word of God, should serve tables.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Look out therefore, brethren, from among yourselves seven men, well reported of, full of [the] [Holy] Spirit and wisdom, whom we will establish over this business:</verse>
  <verse number="4">but we will give ourselves up to prayer and the ministry of the word.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and [the] Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch,</verse>
  <verse number="6">whom they set before the apostles; and, having prayed, they laid their hands on them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem was very greatly multiplied, and a great crowd of the priests obeyed the faith.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Stephen, full of grace and power, wrought wonders and great signs among the people.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And there arose up certain of those of the synagogue called of freedmen, and of Cyrenians, and of Alexandrians, and of those of Cilicia and Asia, disputing with Stephen.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Then they suborned men, saying, We have heard him speaking blasphemous words against Moses and God.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And they roused the people, and the elders, and the scribes. And coming upon [him] they seized him and brought [him] to the council.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And they set false witnesses, saying, This man does not cease speaking words against the holy place and the law;</verse>
  <verse number="14">for we have heard him saying, This Jesus the Nazaraean shall destroy this place, and change the customs which Moses taught us.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And all who sat in the council, looking fixedly on him, saw his face as [the] face of an angel.</verse>
