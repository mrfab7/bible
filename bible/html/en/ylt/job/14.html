<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Man, born of woman! Of few days, and full of trouble!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">As a flower he hath gone forth, and is cut off, And he fleeth as a shadow and standeth not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Also—on this Thou hast opened Thine eyes, And dost bring me into judgment with Thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Who giveth a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If determined are his days, The number of his months are with Thee, His limit Thou hast made, And he passeth not over;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Look away from off him that he may cease, Till he enjoy as an hireling his day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For there is of a tree hope, if it be cut down, That again it doth change, That its tender branch doth not cease.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">If its root becometh old in the earth, And its stem doth die in the dust,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">From the fragrance of water it doth flourish, And hath made a crop as a plant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And a man dieth, and becometh weak, And man expireth, and where is he?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Waters have gone away from a sea, And a river becometh waste and dry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And man hath lain down, and riseth not, Till the wearing out of the heavens they awake not, Nor are roused from their sleep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">O that in Sheol Thou wouldest conceal me, Hide me till the turning of Thine anger, Set for me a limit, and remember me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If a man dieth—doth he revive? All days of my warfare I wait, till my change come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Thou dost call, and I—I answer Thee; To the work of Thy hands Thou hast desire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But now, my steps Thou numberest, Thou dost not watch over my sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Sealed up in a bag is my transgression, And Thou sewest up mine iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And yet, a falling mountain wasteth away, And a rock is removed from its place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Stones have waters worn away, Their outpourings wash away the dust of earth, And the hope of man Thou hast destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Thou prevailest over him for ever, and he goeth, He is changing his countenance, And Thou sendest him away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Honoured are his sons, and he knoweth not; And they are little, and he attendeth not to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Only—his flesh for him is pained, And his soul for him doth mourn.’</p>
