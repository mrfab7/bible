<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Can a man be profitable unto God? Surely he that is wise is profitable unto himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? Or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Is it for thy fear of him that he reproveth thee, That he entereth with thee into judgment?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Is not thy wickedness great? Neither is there any end to thine iniquities.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For thou hast taken pledges of thy brother for nought, And stripped the naked of their clothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, And thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; And the honorable man, he dwelt in it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Thou hast sent widows away empty, And the arms of the fatherless have been broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore snares are round about thee, And sudden fear troubleth thee,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Or darkness, so that thou canst not see, And abundance of waters cover thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Is not God in the height of heaven? And behold the height of the stars, how high they are!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And thou sayest, What doth God know? Can he judge through the thick darkness?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he seeth not; And he walketh on the vault of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Wilt thou keep the old way Which wicked men have trodden?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Who were snatched away before their time, Whose foundation was poured out as a stream,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Who said unto God, Depart from us; And, What can the Almighty do for us?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Yet he filled their houses with good things: But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The righteous see it, and are glad; And the innocent laugh them to scorn,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Saying, Surely they that did rise up against us are cut off, And the remnant of them the fire hath consumed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: Thereby good shall come unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, And lay up his words in thy heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, If thou put away unrighteousness far from thy tents.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And lay thou thy treasure in the dust, And the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And the Almighty will be thy treasure, And precious silver unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For then shalt thou delight thyself in the Almighty, And shalt lift up thy face unto God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he will hear thee; And thou shalt pay thy vows.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee; And light shall shine upon thy ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">When they cast thee down, thou shalt say, There is lifting up; And the humble person he will save.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">He will deliver even him that is not innocent: Yea, he shall be delivered through the cleanness of thy hands.</p>
