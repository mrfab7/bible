  <verse number="1">And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that has an issue, and whoever is defiled by the dead:</verse>
  <verse number="3">Both male and female shall you put out, without the camp shall you put them; that they defile not their camps, in the middle whereof I dwell.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the camp: as the LORD spoke to Moses, so did the children of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="6">Speak to the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the LORD, and that person be guilty;</verse>
  <verse number="7">Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add to it the fifth part thereof, and give it to him against whom he has trespassed.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass to, let the trespass be recompensed to the LORD, even to the priest; beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an atonement shall be made for him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they bring to the priest, shall be his.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And every man’s hallowed things shall be his: whatever any man gives the priest, it shall be his.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="12">Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, If any man’s wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him,</verse>
  <verse number="13">And a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and there be no witness against her, neither she be taken with the manner;</verse>
  <verse number="14">And the spirit of jealousy come on him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy come on him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled:</verse>
  <verse number="15">Then shall the man bring his wife to the priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil on it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the LORD:</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put it into the water:</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD, and uncover the woman’s head, and put the offering of memorial in her hands, which is the jealousy offering: and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causes the curse:</verse>
  <verse number="19">And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say to the woman, If no man have lain with you, and if you have not gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of your husband, be you free from this bitter water that causes the curse:</verse>
  <verse number="20">But if you have gone aside to another instead of your husband, and if you be defiled, and some man have lain with you beside your husband:</verse>
  <verse number="21">Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and the priest shall say to the woman, The LORD make you a curse and an oath among your people, when the LORD does make your thigh to rot, and your belly to swell;</verse>
  <verse number="22">And this water that causes the curse shall go into your bowels, to make your belly to swell, and your thigh to rot: And the woman shall say, Amen, amen.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out with the bitter water:</verse>
  <verse number="24">And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causes the curse: and the water that causes the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman’s hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and offer it on the altar:</verse>
  <verse number="26">And the priest shall take an handful of the offering, even the memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar, and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And when he has made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her husband, that the water that causes the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse among her people.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed.</verse>
  <verse number="29">This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goes aside to another instead of her husband, and is defiled;</verse>
  <verse number="30">Or when the spirit of jealousy comes on him, and he be jealous over his wife, and shall set the woman before the LORD, and the priest shall execute on her all this law.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman shall bear her iniquity.</verse>
