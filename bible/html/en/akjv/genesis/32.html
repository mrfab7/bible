<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God’s host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother to the land of Seir, the country of Edom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall you speak to my lord Esau; Your servant Jacob said thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in your sight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to your brother Esau, and also he comes to meet you, and four hundred men with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which said to me, Return to your country, and to your kindred, and I will deal well with you:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which you have showed to your servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Deliver me, I pray you, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And you said, I will surely do you good, and make your seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Thirty milk camels with their colts, forty cows, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said to his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space between drove and drove.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meets you, and asks you, saying, Whose are you? and where go you? and whose are these before you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Then you shall say, They be your servant Jacob’s; it is a present sent to my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall you speak to Esau, when you find him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And say you moreover, Behold, your servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And he said, Let me go, for the day breaks. And he said, I will not let you go, except you bless me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And he said to him, What is your name? And he said, Jacob.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And he said, Your name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince have you power with God and with men, and have prevailed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray you, your name. And he said, Why is it that you do ask after my name? And he blessed him there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose on him, and he halted on his thigh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is on the hollow of the thigh, to this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew that shrank.</p>
