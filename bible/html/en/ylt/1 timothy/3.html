<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Timothy" data-chapter="3" data-translation="Young's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="ylt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Stedfast is the word: If any one the oversight doth long for, a right work he desireth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">it behoveth, therefore, the overseer to be blameless, of one wife a husband, vigilant, sober, decent, a friend of strangers, apt to teach,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">not given to wine, not a striker, not given to filthy lucre, but gentle, not contentious, not a lover of money,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">his own house leading well, having children in subjection with all gravity,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">(and if any one his own house how to lead hath not known, how an assembly of God shall he take care of?)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">not a new convert, lest having been puffed up he may fall to a judgment of the devil;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">and it behoveth him also to have a good testimony from those without, that he may not fall into reproach and a snare of the devil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Ministrants—in like manner grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not given to filthy lucre,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">having the secret of the faith in a pure conscience,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">and let these also first be proved, then let them minister, being unblameable.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Women—in like manner grave, not false accusers, vigilant, faithful in all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Ministrants—let them be of one wife husbands; the children leading well, and their own houses,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">for those who did minister well a good step to themselves do acquire, and much boldness in faith that is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">These things I write to thee, hoping to come unto thee soon,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">and if I delay, that thou mayest know how it behoveth thee to conduct thyself in the house of God, which is an assembly of the living God—a pillar and foundation of the truth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">and, confessedly, great is the secret of piety—God was manifested in flesh, declared righteous in spirit, seen by messengers, preached among nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory!</p>
