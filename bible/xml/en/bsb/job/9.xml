  <verse number="1">Then Job answered:</verse>
  <verse number="2">“Yes, I know that it is so, but how can a mortal be righteous before God?</verse>
  <verse number="3">If one wished to contend with God, he could not answer Him one time out of a thousand.</verse>
  <verse number="4">God is wise in heart and mighty in strength. Who has resisted Him and prospered?</verse>
  <verse number="5">He moves mountains without their knowledge and overturns them in His anger.</verse>
  <verse number="6">He shakes the earth from its place, so that its foundations tremble.</verse>
  <verse number="7">He commands the sun not to shine; He seals off the stars.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He is the Maker of the Bear and Orion, of the Pleiades and the constellations of the south.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He does great things beyond searching out, and wonders without number.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Were He to pass by me, I would not see Him; were He to move, I would not recognize Him.</verse>
  <verse number="12">If He takes away, who can stop Him? Who dares to ask Him, ‘What are You doing?’</verse>
  <verse number="13">God does not restrain His anger; the helpers of Rahab cower beneath Him.</verse>
  <verse number="14">How then can I answer Him or choose my arguments against Him?</verse>
  <verse number="15">For even if I were right, I could not answer. I could only beg my Judge for mercy.</verse>
  <verse number="16">If I summoned Him and He answered me, I do not believe He would listen to my voice.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For He would crush me with a tempest and multiply my wounds without cause.</verse>
  <verse number="18">He does not let me catch my breath, but overwhelms me with bitterness.</verse>
  <verse number="19">If it is a matter of strength, He is indeed mighty! If it is a matter of justice, who can summon Him?</verse>
  <verse number="20">Even if I were righteous, my mouth would condemn me; if I were blameless, it would declare me guilty.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Though I am blameless, I have no concern for myself; I despise my own life.</verse>
  <verse number="22">It is all the same, and so I say, ‘He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.’</verse>
  <verse number="23">When the scourge brings sudden death, He mocks the despair of the innocent.</verse>
  <verse number="24">The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; He blindfolds its judges. If it is not He, then who is it?</verse>
  <verse number="25">My days are swifter than a runner; they flee without seeing good.</verse>
  <verse number="26">They sweep by like boats of papyrus, like an eagle swooping down on its prey.</verse>
  <verse number="27">If I were to say, ‘I will forget my complaint and change my expression and smile,’</verse>
  <verse number="28">I would still dread all my sufferings; I know that You will not acquit me.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Since I am already found guilty, why should I labor in vain?</verse>
  <verse number="30">If I should wash myself with snow and cleanse my hands with lye,</verse>
  <verse number="31">then You would plunge me into the pit, and even my own clothes would despise me.</verse>
  <verse number="32">For He is not a man like me, that I can answer Him, that we can take each other to court.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Nor is there a mediator between us, to lay his hand upon us both.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Let Him remove His rod from me, so that His terror will no longer frighten me.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Then I would speak without fear of Him. But as it is, I am on my own.</verse>
