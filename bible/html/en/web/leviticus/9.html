<p class="verse" data-verse="1">It happened on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and he said to Aaron, “Take a calf from the herd for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before Yahweh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both a year old, without blemish, for a burnt offering;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">and a bull and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before Yahweh; and a meal offering mixed with oil: for today Yahweh appears to you.’”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">They brought what Moses commanded before the Tent of Meeting: and all the congregation drew near and stood before Yahweh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Moses said, “This is the thing which Yahweh commanded that you should do: and the glory of Yahweh shall appear to you.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Moses said to Aaron, “Draw near to the altar, and offer your sin offering, and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself, and for the people; and offer the offering of the people, and make atonement for them; as Yahweh commanded.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">So Aaron drew near to the altar, and killed the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The sons of Aaron presented the blood to him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">but the fat, and the kidneys, and the cover from the liver of the sin offering, he burned upon the altar; as Yahweh commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The flesh and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">He killed the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons delivered the blood to him, and he sprinkled it around on the altar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They delivered the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head: and he burned them upon the altar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">He washed the innards and the legs, and burned them on the burnt offering on the altar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He presented the people’s offering, and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people, and killed it, and offered it for sin, like the first.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He presented the burnt offering, and offered it according to the ordinance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He presented the meal offering, and filled his hand from there, and burned it upon the altar, besides the burnt offering of the morning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He also killed the bull and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron’s sons delivered to him the blood, which he sprinkled around on the altar,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">and the fat of the bull and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covers the innards, and the kidneys, and the cover of the liver:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burned the fat on the altar:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">and the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave offering before Yahweh, as Moses commanded.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of Yahweh appeared to all the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">There came forth fire from before Yahweh, and consumed the burnt offering and the fat upon the altar: and when all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces.</p>
