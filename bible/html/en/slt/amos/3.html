<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Hear this word which Jehovah spake against you, ye sons of Israel, against all the family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">You only did I know from all the families of the earth: for this I will review over you all your iniquities.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Shall two go together if they met not by appointment?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Will the lion roar in the forest and not tearing in pieces for him? will the young lion give his voice from his cave if he took nothing?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Will the bird fall upon the snare of the earth and no noose for her? shall a snare be brought up from the earth and a taking shall not be taken?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If the trumpet shall be struck in the city and the people not be terrified? if evil shall be in the city and Jehovah did not?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For the Lord Jehovah will not do a word but he will uncover his secret to his servants the prophets.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The lion roared, who shall not be afraid? the Lord Jehovah spake, who shall not prophesy?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Cause to be heard upon the palaces in Ashdod, and upon the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Be ye gathered together upon the mountains of Shomeron, and see the great tumults in the midst of her, and the oppressed in the midst of her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And they knew not to do the straight, says Jehovah, storing up violence and oppression in their palaces.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: An adversary and round about the land; and he brought down thy strength from thee, and thy palaces were plundered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Thus said Jehovah: As the shepherd will deliver from the mouth of the lion two legs, and part of an ear, thus shall the sons of Israel be delivered dwelling in Shomeron in the extremity of a tribe, or in Damascus under a roof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, says the Lord Jehovah, God of armies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For in the day of my reviewing the transgressions of Israel upon him, and reviewed upon the altars of the house of God: and the horns of the altar were broken, and they fell to the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And I struck the house of autumn with the house of summer; and the houses of ivory perished, and the great houses were taken away, says Jehovah.</p>
