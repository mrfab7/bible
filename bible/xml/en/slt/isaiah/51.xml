  <verse number="1">Hear to me, ye pursuing justice, seeking Jehovah: look to the rock ye hewed, and at the quarry of the pit ye dug out.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Look to Abraham your father, and to Sarah bringing you forth: for one I called him, and I will bless him, and I will increase him.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For Jehovah comforted Zion: he comforted all her wastes, and he will set her desert as Eden, and her sterile region as the garden of Jehovah; joy and gladness shall be found in her confession, and the voice of song.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Attend to me, my people, and give ear to me, my nation: for a law shall go forth from me, and I will cause my judgment to rest for the light of the peoples.</verse>
  <verse number="5">My justice is near; my salvation went forth, and mine arms shall judge the peoples; the islands shall wait for me, and to mine arm shall they hope.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look to the earth from beneath: for the heavens as smoke vanished away, and the earth as a garment shall decay, and they inhabiting as thus shall die; and my salvation shall be forever, and my justice shall not be broken.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Hear to me, ye knowing justice, the people my law in their heart; ye shall not fear the reproach of men; and from their reviling ye shall not be dismayed.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For the moth shall eat them as a garment, and as wool shall the moth eat them: and my justice shall be forever, and my salvation to generation of generations.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Rouse up, rouse up, put on strength, thou arm of Jehovah; rouse up as the days of old, of everlasting generations. Was it not with him cutting off Rahab, wounding the sea monster?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Was it not with him desolating the sea, the water of the great deep? setting the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over?</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the redeemed of Jehovah shall turn back, and they came to Zion with shouting and eternal joy upon their head: and gladness and joy shall they attain; sorrow and sighing fled.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I, I am he comforting you: who thou? and shalt thou be afraid of man he shall die, and of the son of man shall be given for grass?</verse>
  <verse number="13">And shalt thou forget Jehovah making thee, stretching out the heavens and founding the earth? and thou wilt tremble continually all the day from the face of the anger of him pressing as being prepared to destroy: and where the wrath of him pressing?</verse>
  <verse number="14">He being bowed down hastened to be loosed, and he will not die in the pit, and his bread shall not fail.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And I am Jehovah thy God causing the sea to tremble. And its billows shall be put in motion: Jehovah of armies his name.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And I will put my word in thy mouth, and in the shadow of my hand I covered thee, to plant the heavens and to found the earth, and to say to Zion, Thou my people.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Arise, arise, stand up, O Jerusalem, who drank from the hand of Jehovah the cup of his wrath; thou didst drink the goblet cup of reeling, pressing out.</verse>
  <verse number="18">None providing for her of all the sons she brought forth; and none holding by her hand of all the sons she caused to grow.</verse>
  <verse number="19">These two encountering thee; who shall be moved for thee? desolation and breaking, and famine, and the sword: by whom shall I comfort thee?</verse>
  <verse number="20">Thy sons fainted; they lay down upon the head of all the streets as an antelope in a net: being full of the wrath of Jehovah the rebuke of thy God.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For this, bear now this, thou afflicted and drunken, and not from wine:</verse>
  <verse number="22">Thus said thy Lord Jehovah and thy God, he will contend for his people, Behold, I took from thy hand the cup of reeling, the goblet cup of my wrath; thou shalt not add to drink it more.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And I put it in the hand of those afflicting thee; who said to thy soul, Bow down, and we will pass over; thou wilt set thy middle as the earth, and as the street to those passing over.</verse>
