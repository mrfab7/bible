<p class="verse" data-verse="1">After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed his day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Job answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Let the day perish in which I was born, and the night that said, There is a man child conceived.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">That day—let it be darkness, let not +God care for it from above, neither let light shine upon it:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it; let clouds dwell upon it; let darkeners of the day terrify it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">That night—let gloom seize upon it; let it not rejoice among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Behold, let that night be barren; let no joyful sound come therein;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to rouse Leviathan;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Let the stars of its twilight be dark; let it wait for light, and have none, neither let it see the eyelids of the dawn:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Because it shut not up the doors of the womb that bore me, and hid not trouble from mine eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Wherefore did I not die from the womb,—come forth from the belly and expire?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Why did the knees meet me? and wherefore the breasts, that I should suck?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For now should I have lain down and been quiet; I should have slept: then had I been at rest,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">With kings and counsellors of the earth, who build desolate places for themselves,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants that have not seen the light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the wearied are at rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The prisoners together are at ease; they hear not the voice of the taskmaster.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The small and great are there, and the bondman freed from his master.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Wherefore is light given to him that is in trouble, and life to those bitter of soul,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Who long for death, and it [cometh] not, and dig for it more than for hidden treasures;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Who rejoice even exultingly and are glad when they find the grave?—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">To the man whose way is hidden, and whom +God hath hedged in?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For my sighing cometh before my bread, and my groanings are poured out like the waters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For I feared a fear, and it hath come upon me, and that which I dreaded hath come to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">I was not in safety, neither had I quietness, neither was I at rest, and trouble came.</p>
