  <verse number="1">Now it happened that, when Solomon had perfected the building of the house of the Lord, and the king’s house, and all that he had desired and had willed to do,</verse>
  <verse number="2">the Lord appeared to him a second time, just as he had appeared to him at Gibeon.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the Lord said to him: “I have heard your prayer and your petition, which you prayed before me. I have sanctified this house, which you have built, so that I may place my name there forever, and so that my eyes and my heart will be there for all days.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Also, if you will walk before me, just as your father walked, in simplicity of heart and in equity, and you do all that I have instructed to you, and you keep my laws and my judgments,</verse>
  <verse number="5">then I will set the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, just as I promised your father David, saying: ‘A man from your stock shall not be taken away from the throne of Israel.’</verse>
  <verse number="6">But if you and your sons, wandering, will have turned away, not following me, and not keeping my commandments and my ceremonies, which I have proposed to you, but instead you go away, and you serve strange gods and adore them,</verse>
  <verse number="7">then I will take away Israel from the face of the land, which I have given to them. And the temple, which I have sanctified to my name, I will cast out from my sight. And Israel will be a proverb and a parable among all the peoples.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And this house will become an example: anyone who passes by it will be stupefied, and he will hiss and say, ‘Why has the Lord acted in this way to this land and to this house?’</verse>
  <verse number="9">And they will respond: ‘Because they abandoned the Lord their God, who led their fathers away from the land of Egypt, and they followed strange gods, and they adored them and served them. For this reason, the Lord led all this evil over them.’ ”</verse>
  <verse number="10">Then, when twenty years were fulfilled, after Solomon had built the two houses, that is, the house of the Lord, and the house of the king,</verse>
  <verse number="11">Hiram, the king of Tyre, having supplied Solomon with cedar wood, and spruce wood, and gold, in accord with all that he needed, then Solomon gave Hiram twenty towns in the land of Galilee.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Hiram went out of Tyre, so that he might view the towns that Solomon had given to him. And they did not please him.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And he said, “Are these the cities that you have given to me, brother?” And he called them the land of Cabul, even to this day.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Hiram sent to king Solomon one hundred twenty talents of gold.</verse>
  <verse number="15">This is the sum of the expenses that king Solomon offered for the building of the house of the Lord, and his own house, and for Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, ascended and seized Gezer, and he burned it with fire. And he put to death the Canaanite who was living in the city, and he gave it as a dowry for his daughter, the wife of Solomon.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Therefore, Solomon built up Gezer, and lower Beth-horon,</verse>
  <verse number="18">and Baalath, and Palmira in the land of the wilderness.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And all the towns which belonged to him, and which were without walls, he walled, along with the cities of the chariots, and the cities of the horsemen, and whatever was pleasing to him that he might build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in the entire land of his dominion.</verse>
  <verse number="20">All the people who had remained of the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the sons of Israel,</verse>
  <verse number="21">their sons, who had remained in the land, namely, those whom the sons of Israel had not been able to destroy, Solomon made tributary, even to this day.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But from the sons of Israel, Solomon did not appoint anyone at all to serve, except the men of war, and his ministers, and leaders, and commanders, and the overseers of the chariots and the horses.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Now there were five hundred fifty leaders in the first place over all the works of Solomon, and they had people subject to them, and these were given orders for the appointed works.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And the daughter of Pharaoh went up from the city of David to her house, which Solomon had built for her. Then he built up Millo.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Also, three times each year, Solomon offered holocausts and victims of peace offerings, upon the altar that he had built to the Lord, and he burned incense before the Lord. And the temple was perfected.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And king Solomon made a navy at Ezion Geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shores of the Red Sea, in the land of Idumea.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And Hiram sent his servants to that navy, the sailors and those knowledgeable about the sea, with the servants of Solomon.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And when they had gone to Ophir, taking from there four hundred twenty talents of gold, they brought it to king Solomon.</verse>
