<chapter book="Isaiah" number="38" translation="World English Bible" translationID="web" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">In those days was Hezekiah sick and near death. Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came to him, and said to him, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘Set your house in order, for you will die, and not live.’”</verse>
  <verse number="2">Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to Yahweh,</verse>
  <verse number="3">and said, “Remember now, Yahweh, I beg you, how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your sight.” Hezekiah wept bitterly.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Then the word of Yahweh came to Isaiah, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="5">“Go, and tell Hezekiah, ‘Thus says Yahweh, the God of David your father, “I have heard your prayer. I have seen your tears. Behold, I will add fifteen years to your life.</verse>
  <verse number="6">I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city.</verse>
  <verse number="7">This shall be the sign to you from Yahweh, that Yahweh will do this thing that he has spoken.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Behold, I will cause the shadow on the sundial, which has gone down on the sundial of Ahaz with the sun, to return backward ten steps. So the sun returned ten steps on the sundial on which it had gone down.”’”</verse>
  <verse number="9">The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and had recovered of his sickness.</verse>
  <verse number="10">I said, “In the middle of my life I go into the gates of Sheol. I am deprived of the residue of my years.”</verse>
  <verse number="11">I said, “I won’t see Yah, Yah in the land of the living. I will see man no more with the inhabitants of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="12">My dwelling is removed, and is carried away from me like a shepherd’s tent. I have rolled up, like a weaver, my life. He will cut me off from the loom. From day even to night you will make an end of me.</verse>
  <verse number="13">I waited patiently until morning. He breaks all my bones like a lion. From day even to night you will make an end of me.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I chattered like a swallow or a crane. I moaned like a dove. My eyes weaken looking upward. Lord, I am oppressed. Be my security.”</verse>
  <verse number="15">What will I say? He has both spoken to me, and himself has done it. I will walk carefully all my years because of the anguish of my soul.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Lord, men live by these things; and my spirit finds life in all of them: you restore me, and cause me to live.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Behold, for peace I had great anguish, but you have in love for my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption; for you have cast all my sins behind your back.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For Sheol can’t praise you. Death can’t celebrate you. Those who go down into the pit can’t hope for your truth.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The living, the living, he shall praise you, as I do this day. The father shall make known your truth to the children.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Yahweh will save me. Therefore we will sing my songs with stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of Yahweh.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Now Isaiah had said, “Let them take a cake of figs, and lay it for a poultice on the boil, and he shall recover.”</verse>
  <verse number="22">Hezekiah also had said, “What is the sign that I will go up to the house of Yahweh?”</verse>
