  <verse number="1">Where went thy beloved, O beautiful one among women? where turned away thy beloved, and we will seek him with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="2">My beloved went down to his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I to my beloved, and my beloved to me: he feeding among the lilies.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Thou art beautiful my friend, as delight; becoming as Jerusalem, a terror as those being furnished with banners.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Turn away thine eyes from before me; they enlarged me: thy hair as a herd of goats which lay down from Gilead.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Thy teeth as a herd of sheep which went up from the washing, all of them bearing twins, and none barren among them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">As a piece of pomegranate thy temples from behind thy veil.</verse>
  <verse number="8">They are sixty queens, and eighty concubines, and maidens no number.</verse>
  <verse number="9">She is one, my dove, my perfect one; she is one to her mother, she is the chosen to her bearing her. The daughters saw her and pronounced her happy; the queens and the concubines, and they will praise her.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Who this looking forth as the morning, beautiful as the moon, clear as the sun, a terror as those being furnished with banners?</verse>
  <verse number="11">I went down into the garden of nuts to look upon the greens of the valley, to see whether the vine was fruitful, whether the pomegranates blossomed.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I knew not my soul set me the chariots of my willing people.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Turn back, turn back, thou Shulamite; turn back, turn back, and we will look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As the stringed instrument of the camps.</verse>
