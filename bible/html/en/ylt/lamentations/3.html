<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I am the man who hath seen affliction By the rod of His wrath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Me He hath led, and causeth to go in darkness, and without light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Surely against me He turneth back, He turneth His hand all the day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">He hath worn out my flesh and my skin. He hath broken my bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He hath built up against me, And setteth round poverty and weariness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">In dark places He hath caused me to dwell, As the dead of old.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He hath hedged me about, and I go not out, He hath made heavy my fetter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Also when I call and cry out, He hath shut out my prayer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He hath hedged my ways with hewn work, My paths He hath made crooked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">A bear lying in wait He is to me, A lion in secret hiding-places.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">My ways He is turning aside, and He pulleth me in pieces, He hath made me a desolation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">He hath trodden His bow, And setteth me up as a mark for an arrow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He hath caused to enter into my reins The sons of His quiver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I have been a derision to all my people, Their song all the day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He hath filled me with bitter things, He hath filled me with wormwood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And He breaketh with gravel my teeth, He hath covered me with ashes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And Thou castest off from peace my soul, I have forgotten prosperity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And I say, Perished hath my strength and my hope from Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Remember my affliction and my mourning, Wormwood and gall!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Remember well, and bow down doth my soul in me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">This I turn to my heart—therefore I hope.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The kindnesses of Jehovah! For we have not been consumed, For not ended have His mercies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">New every morning, abundant is thy faithfulness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">My portion is Jehovah, hath my soul said, Therefore I hope for Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Good is Jehovah to those waiting for Him, To the soul that seeketh Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Good! when one doth stay and stand still For the salvation of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Good for a man that he beareth a yoke in his youth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">He sitteth alone, and is silent, For He hath laid it upon him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">He putteth in the dust his mouth, if so be there is hope.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">He giveth to his smiter the cheek, He is filled with reproach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">For the Lord doth not cast off to the age.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">For though He afflicted, yet He hath pitied, According to the abundance of His kindness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">For He hath not afflicted with His heart, Nor doth He grieve the sons of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">To bruise under one’s feet any bound ones of earth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">To turn aside the judgment of a man, Over-against the face of the Most High,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord hath not approved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">Who is this—he hath said, and it is, And the Lord hath not commanded it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">From the mouth of the Most High Go not forth the evils and the good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">What—sigh habitually doth a living man, A man for his sin?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">We search our ways, and investigate, And turn back unto Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">We lift up our heart on the hands unto God in the heavens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">We—we have transgressed and rebelled, Thou—Thou hast not forgiven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">Thou hast covered Thyself with anger, And dost pursue us; Thou hast slain—Thou hast not pitied.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">Thou hast covered Thyself with a cloud, So that prayer doth not pass through.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">Offscouring and refuse Thou dost make us In the midst of the peoples.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">Opened against us their mouth have all our enemies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">Fear and a snare hath been for us, Desolation and destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">Rivulets of water go down my eye, For the destruction of the daughter of my people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">Mine eye is poured out, And doth not cease without intermission,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">Till Jehovah looketh and seeth from the heavens,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">My eye affecteth my soul, Because of all the daughters of my city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="52">Hunted me sore as a bird have my enemies without cause.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">They have cut off in a pit my life, And they cast a stone against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="54">Flowed have waters over my head, I have said, I have been cut off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="55">I called Thy name, O Jehovah, from the lower pit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="56">My voice Thou hast heard, Hide not Thine ear at my breathing—at my cry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="57">Thou hast drawn near in the day I call Thee, Thou hast said, Fear not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="58">Thou hast pleaded, O Lord, the pleadings of my soul, Thou hast redeemed my life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="59">Thou hast seen, O Jehovah, my overthrow, Judge Thou my cause.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="60">Thou hast seen all their vengeance, All their thoughts of me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="61">Thou hast heard their reproach, O Jehovah, All their thoughts against me,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="62">The lips of my withstanders, Even their meditation against me all the day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="63">Their sitting down, and their rising up, Behold attentively, I am their song.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="64">Thou returnest to them the deed, O Jehovah, According to the work of their hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="65">Thou givest to them a covered heart, Thy curse to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="66">Thou pursuest in anger, and destroyest them, From under the heavens of Jehovah!</p>
