<chapter book="Isaiah" number="32" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear shall listen.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.</verse>
  <verse number="5">The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl said to be bountiful.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For the vile person will speak villainy, and his heart will work iniquity, to practice hypocrisy, and to utter error against the LORD, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The instruments also of the churl are evil: he devises wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when the needy speaks right.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But the liberal devises liberal things; and by liberal things shall he stand.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Rise up, you women that are at ease; hear my voice, you careless daughters; give ear to my speech.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Many days and years shall you be troubled, you careless women: for the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Tremble, you women that are at ease; be troubled, you careless ones: strip you, and make you bore, and gird sackcloth on your loins.</verse>
  <verse number="12">They shall lament for the teats, for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.</verse>
  <verse number="13">On the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers; yes, on all the houses of joy in the joyous city:</verse>
  <verse number="14">Because the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the city shall be left; the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;</verse>
  <verse number="15">Until the spirit be poured on us from on high, and the wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness remain in the fruitful field.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places;</verse>
  <verse number="19">When it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and the city shall be low in a low place.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Blessed are you that sow beside all waters, that send forth thither the feet of the ox and the ass.</verse>
