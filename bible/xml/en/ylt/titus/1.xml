<chapter book="Titus" number="1" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the choice ones of God, and an acknowledging of truth that is according to piety,</verse>
  <verse number="2">upon hope of life age-during, which God, who doth not lie, did promise before times of ages,</verse>
  <verse number="3">(and He manifested in proper times His word,) in preaching, which I was entrusted with, according to a charge of God our Saviour,</verse>
  <verse number="4">to Titus—true child according to a common faith: Grace, kindness, peace, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour!</verse>
  <verse number="5">For this cause left I thee in Crete, that the things lacking thou mayest arrange, and mayest set down in every city elders, as I did appoint to thee;</verse>
  <verse number="6">if any one is blameless, of one wife a husband, having children stedfast, not under accusation of riotous living or insubordinate—</verse>
  <verse number="7">for it behoveth the overseer to be blameless, as God’s steward, not self-pleased, nor irascible, not given to wine, not a striker, not given to filthy lucre;</verse>
  <verse number="8">but a lover of strangers, a lover of good men, sober-minded, righteous, kind, self-controlled,</verse>
  <verse number="9">holding—according to the teaching—to the stedfast word, that he may be able also to exhort in the sound teaching, and the gainsayers to convict;</verse>
  <verse number="10">for there are many both insubordinate, vain-talkers, and mind-deceivers—especially they of the circumcision—</verse>
  <verse number="11">whose mouth it behoveth to stop, who whole households do overturn, teaching what things it behoveth not, for filthy lucre’s sake.</verse>
  <verse number="12">A certain one of them, a prophet of their own, said—‘Cretans! always liars, evil beasts, lazy bellies!’</verse>
  <verse number="13">this testimony is true; for which cause convict them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,</verse>
  <verse number="14">not giving heed to Jewish fables and commands of men, turning themselves away from the truth;</verse>
  <verse number="15">all things, indeed, are pure to the pure, and to the defiled and unstedfast is nothing pure, but of them defiled are even the mind and the conscience;</verse>
  <verse number="16">God they profess to know, and in the works they deny Him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work disapproved.</verse>
