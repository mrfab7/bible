<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Should not the multitude of words be answered? And should a man full of talk be justified?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Should thy boastings make men hold their peace? And when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For thou sayest, My doctrine is pure, And I am clean in thine eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But oh that God would speak, And open his lips against thee,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And that he would show thee the secrets of wisdom! For he is manifold in understanding. Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Canst thou by searching find out God? Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">It is high as heaven; what canst thou do? Deeper than Sheol; what canst thou know?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The measure thereof is longer than the earth, And broader than the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">If he pass through, and shut up, And call unto judgment, then who can hinder him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For he knoweth false men: He seeth iniquity also, even though he consider it not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But vain man is void of understanding, Yea, man is born as a wild assâ€™s colt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If thou set thy heart aright, And stretch out thy hands toward him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If iniquity be in thy hand, put it far away, And let not unrighteousness dwell in thy tents.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Surely then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; Yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For thou shalt forget thy misery; Thou shalt remember it as waters that are passed away,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And thy life shall be clearer than the noonday; Though there be darkness, it shall be as the morning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; Yea, thou shalt search about thee, and shalt take thy rest in safety.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; Yea, many shall make suit unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, And they shall have no way to flee; And their hope shall be the giving up of the ghost.</p>
