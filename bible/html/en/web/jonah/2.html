<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Jonah prayed to Yahweh, his God, out of the fish’s belly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">He said, “I called because of my affliction to Yahweh. He answered me. Out of the belly of Sheol I cried. You heard my voice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For you threw me into the depths, in the heart of the seas. The flood was all around me. All your waves and your billows passed over me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I said, ‘I have been banished from your sight; yet I will look again toward your holy temple.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The waters surrounded me, even to the soul. The deep was around me. The weeds were wrapped around my head.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I went down to the bottoms of the mountains. The earth barred me in forever: yet have you brought up my life from the pit, Yahweh my God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">“When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Yahweh. My prayer came in to you, into your holy temple.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Those who regard lying vanities forsake their own mercy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But I will sacrifice to you with the voice of thanksgiving. I will pay that which I have vowed. Salvation belongs to Yahweh.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Yahweh spoke to the fish, and it vomited out Jonah on the dry land.</p>
