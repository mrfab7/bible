  <verse number="52">Destroy all the inhabitants of that land: beat down their pillars, and break in pieces their statues, and waste all their high places,</verse>
  <verse number="53">Cleansing the land, and dwelling in it. For I have given it you for a possession.</verse>
  <verse number="54">And you shall divide it among you by lot. To the more you shall give a larger part, and to the fewer a lesser. To every one as the lot shall fall, so shall the inheritance be given. The possession shall be divided by the tribes and the families.</verse>
