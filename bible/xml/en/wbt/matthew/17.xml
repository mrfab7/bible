  <verse number="1">And after six days, Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them upon a high mountain apart.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he was transfigured before them: and his face shone as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah talking with him.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Then answered Peter, and said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.</verse>
  <verse number="5">While he was yet speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold, a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased: hear ye him.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were in great fear.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And as they were descending the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be raised again from the dead.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes, that Elijah must first come?</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Jesus answered and said to them, Elijah truly will first come, and restore all things:</verse>
  <verse number="12">But I say to you, that Elijah is come already, and they knew him not, but have done to him whatever they pleased: likewise will also the Son of man suffer by them.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them concerning John the Baptist.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And when they had come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man kneeling down to him, and saying,</verse>
  <verse number="15">Lord, have mercy on my son; for he is lunatic, and grievously distressed; for often he falleth into the fire, and often into the water.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Jesus rebuked the demon, and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Jesus said to them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say to you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard-seed, ye shall say to this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place, and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible to you.</verse>
  <verse number="21">However, this kind goeth not out, but by prayer and fasting.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man will be betrayed into the hands of men:</verse>
  <verse number="23">And they will kill him, and the third day he will be raised again: And they were exceedingly grieved.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And when they had come to Capernaum, they that received tribute-money, came to Peter, and said, Doth not your Master pay tribute?</verse>
  <verse number="25">He saith, Yes. And when he had come into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? from whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? from their own children, or from strangers?</verse>
  <verse number="26">Peter saith to him, From strangers. Jesus saith to him, Then are the children free.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast a hook, and take the fish that first cometh up: and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: take that, and give to them for me and thee.</verse>
