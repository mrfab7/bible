  <verse number="1">At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,</verse>
  <verse number="2">And said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias’ sake, his brother Philip’s wife.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For John said to him, It is not lawful for you to have her.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But when Herod’s birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatever she would ask.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist’s head in a charger.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath’s sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="13">When Jesus heard of it, he departed there by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But Jesus said to them, They need not depart; give you them to eat.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And they say to him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.</verse>
  <verse number="18">He said, Bring them here to me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and broke, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him to the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.</verse>
  <verse number="24">But the ship was now in the middle of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.</verse>
  <verse number="27">But straightway Jesus spoke to them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be you, bid me come to you on the water.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="30">But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said to him, O you of little faith, why did you doubt?</verse>
  <verse number="32">And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth you are the Son of God.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought to him all that were diseased;</verse>
  <verse number="36">And sought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.</verse>
