<chapter book="Job" number="34" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Furthermore Elihu answered and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Hear my words, O you wise men; and give ear to me, you that have knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For the ear tries words, as the mouth tastes meat.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For Job has said, I am righteous: and God has taken away my judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.</verse>
  <verse number="7">What man is like Job, who drinks up scorning like water?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Which goes in company with the workers of iniquity, and walks with wicked men.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For he has said, It profits a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Therefore listen to me you men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For the work of a man shall he render to him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Yes, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Who has given him a charge over the earth? or who has disposed the whole world?</verse>
  <verse number="14">If he set his heart on man, if he gather to himself his spirit and his breath;</verse>
  <verse number="15">All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again to dust.</verse>
  <verse number="16">If now you have understanding, hear this: listen to the voice of my words.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Shall even he that hates right govern? and will you condemn him that is most just?</verse>
  <verse number="18">Is it fit to say to a king, You are wicked? and to princes, You are ungodly?</verse>
  <verse number="19">How much less to him that accepts not the persons of princes, nor regards the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.</verse>
  <verse number="20">In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For his eyes are on the ways of man, and he sees all his goings.</verse>
  <verse number="22">There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For he will not lay on man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.</verse>
  <verse number="24">He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Therefore he knows their works, and he overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed.</verse>
  <verse number="26">He strikes them as wicked men in the open sight of others;</verse>
  <verse number="27">Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:</verse>
  <verse number="28">So that they cause the cry of the poor to come to him, and he hears the cry of the afflicted.</verse>
  <verse number="29">When he gives quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hides his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:</verse>
  <verse number="30">That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Surely it is meet to be said to God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:</verse>
  <verse number="32">That which I see not teach you me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Should it be according to your mind? he will recompense it, whether you refuse, or whether you choose; and not I: therefore speak what you know.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man listen to me.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Job has spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.</verse>
  <verse number="36">My desire is that Job may be tried to the end because of his answers for wicked men.</verse>
  <verse number="37">For he adds rebellion to his sin, he clapps his hands among us, and multiplies his words against God.</verse>
