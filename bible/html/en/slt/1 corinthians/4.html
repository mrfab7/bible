<p class="verse" data-verse="1">So let a man reckon us, as servants of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And besides it is sought in stewards, that any one be found faithful.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And to me it is the least that I be judged by you, or by manâ€™s day: but neither do I judge myself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For I know nothing by myself; but in this I have not been justified: and he examining me is the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Therefore judge ye nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who also, will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make manifest the counsels of hearts: and then shall praise be to each from God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And these things, brethren, I transformed to myself and to Apollos for you; that ye might learn in us not to think above what has been written, lest ye be puffed up one above one against the other.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For who distinguishes thee? and what hast thou which thou didst not receive? and if thou also didst receive, why dost thou boast, as not having received?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Already were ye satisfied, already were ye rich, without us ye reigned; and I would ye also reigned, that we also might reign together with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For I think that God has exhibited us the last sent, as exposed to death; for we were a theatre to the world, and to messengers, and to men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">We foolish for Christ, and ye wise in Christ; we weak, and ye strong; ye honourable, and we dishonoured.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Until this present hour we also hunger, and thirst, and we are naked, and are cuffed, and are unsteady.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And we are wearied, working with our own hands: being reviled, we praise; being driven out, we hold up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Being defamed, we entreat: as the filth of the world were we become, the offscouring of all until now.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Not shaming you, write I these, but as my beloved children I admonish you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For if ye have ten thousand preceptors in Christ, but not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus by the good news I begat you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">I beseech you therefore, be ye imitators of me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Therefore sent I Timotheus to you, who is my beloved child, and faithful in the Lord, who will remind you of all my ways in Christ, as I teach everywhere in all the churches.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And as my not coming to you, some were puffed up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And I will come to you swiftly, if the Lord will, and I shall know not the word of those puffed up, but the power.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For the kingdom of God not in word, but in power.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">What will ye? should I come to you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?</p>
