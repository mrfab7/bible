<div class="chapter" data-book="Isaiah" data-chapter="16" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Send you the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderness, to the mount of the daughter of Zion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For it shall be, that, as a wandering bird cast out of the nest, so the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Take counsel, execute judgment; make your shadow as the night in the middle of the noonday; hide the outcasts; denude not him that wanders.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Let my outcasts dwell with you, Moab; be you a covert to them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortionist is at an end, the spoiler ceases, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit on it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment, and hastening righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud: even of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: but his lies shall not be so.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for the foundations of Kirhareseth shall you mourn; surely they are stricken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah: the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof, they are come even to Jazer, they wandered through the wilderness: her branches are stretched out, they are gone over the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Therefore I will mourn with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah: I will water you with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for the shouting for your summer fruits and for your harvest is fallen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses; I have made their vintage shouting to cease.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Why my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and my inward parts for Kirharesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not prevail.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">This is the word that the LORD has spoken concerning Moab since that time.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But now the LORD has spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of an hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be contemned, with all that great multitude; and the remnant shall be very small and feeble.</p>
