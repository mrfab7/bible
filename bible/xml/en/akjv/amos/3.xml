  <verse number="1">Hear this word that the LORD has spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Can two walk together, except they be agreed?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Will a lion roar in the forest, when he has no prey? will a young lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Can a bird fall in a snare on the earth, where no gin is for him? shall one take up a snare from the earth, and have taken nothing at all?</verse>
  <verse number="6">Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD has not done it?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he reveals his secret to his servants the prophets.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The lion has roared, who will not fear? the Lord GOD has spoken, who can but prophesy?</verse>
  <verse number="9">Publish in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria, and behold the great tumults in the middle thereof, and the oppressed in the middle thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For they know not to do right, said the LORD, who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; An adversary there shall be even round about the land; and he shall bring down your strength from you, and your palaces shall be spoiled.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Thus said the LORD; As the shepherd takes out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed, and in Damascus in a couch.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Hear you, and testify in the house of Jacob, said the Lord GOD, the God of hosts,</verse>
  <verse number="14">That in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel on him I will also visit the altars of Bethel: and the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the ground.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And I will smite the winter house with the summer house; and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end, said the LORD.</verse>
