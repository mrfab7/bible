  <verse number="1">My spirit being destroyed my days were extinct; the graves are for me.</verse>
  <verse number="2">If not mockings with me? and shall not mine eye lodge in their bitterness?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Set up now, pledge me with thee: who is he will strike for my hand?</verse>
  <verse number="4">For thou didst hide their heart from understanding; for this thou wilt not exalt them.</verse>
  <verse number="5">He will commence evils for a position, and the eyes of his sons shall be consumed.</verse>
  <verse number="6">He set me for a parable of the peoples, and I shall be one spit upon to the face.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And mine eye shall be weak from vexation, and my thoughts as a shadow all of them.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The upright shall be astonished upon this, and the innocent Shall arouse himself against the profane.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the just shall hold on his way, and the clean one of hands shall add strength.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But ye all shall turn back, and come ye now, and I shall not find a wise one among you.</verse>
  <verse number="11">My days passed away, my purposes were broken; the possessions of my heart.</verse>
  <verse number="12">They will set the night for day: the light being near from the face of darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="13">If I shall wait, hades is my house: in darkness I spread my bed.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I called to the pit: Grave, thou my father: and to the worm, My mother, and my sister.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And where now my hope? and my hope who shall regard it?</verse>
  <verse number="16">They shall go down to the bars of hades if together we shall go down to the dust.</verse>
