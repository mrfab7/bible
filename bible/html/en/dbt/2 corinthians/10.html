<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But I myself, Paul, entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of the Christ, who, as to appearance, [when present] [am] mean among you, but absent am bold towards you;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">but I beseech that present I may not be bold with the confidence with which I think to be daring towards some who think of us as walking according to flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For walking in flesh, we do not war according to flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For the arms of our warfare [are] not fleshly, but powerful according to God to [the] overthrow of strongholds;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">overthrowing reasonings and every high thing that lifts itself up against the knowledge of God, and leading captive every thought into the obedience of the Christ;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and having in readiness to avenge all disobedience when your obedience shall have been fulfilled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Do ye look at what concerns appearance? If any one has confidence in himself that he is of Christ, let him think this again in himself, that even as he [is] of Christ, so also [are] we.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For and if I should boast even somewhat more abundantly of our authority, which the Lord has given [to us] for building up and not for your overthrowing, I shall not be put to shame;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">that I may not seem as if I was frightening you by letters:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">because his letters, he says, [are] weighty and strong, but his presence in the body weak, and his speech naught.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Let such a one think this, that such as we are in word by letters [when] absent, such also present in deed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For we dare not class ourselves or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves; but these, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are not intelligent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Now we will not boast out of measure, but according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure has apportioned to us, to reach to you also.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For we do not, as not reaching to you, overstretch ourselves, (for we have come to you also in the glad tidings of the Christ;)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">not boasting out of measure in other people’s labours, but having hope, your faith increasing, to be enlarged amongst you, according to our rule, yet more abundantly</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">to announce the glad tidings to that [which is] beyond you, not to be boasting in another’s rule of things made ready to hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But he that boasts, let him boast in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For not he that commends himself is approved, but whom the Lord commends.</p>
