<p class="verse" data-verse="1">If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not love, I have been the brass of echoes, and the shouting cymbal.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And if I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries, and all knowledge; and if I have all faith to remove mountains, and have not love, I am nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And if I feed out all my goods, and if I deliver my body that I be burned, and have not love, I am profited nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Love is slow to anger, possesses kindness; love envies not; love vaunts not itself, is not puffed up,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">It demeans itself not unbecomingly, seeks not the things of itself, is not irritated, reckons no evil;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Rejoices not at injustice, and rejoices with the truth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Covers all things, believes all, hopes all things, endures all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Love never falters: but whether gifts of prophecies, they shall be left unemployed; whether tongues, they shall cease; whether knowledge, it shall be left unemployed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For we know by parts, and we prophesy by parts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And when the perfected come, then shall that by parts be left unemployed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">When I was a child, as a child I spake, as a child I thought, as a child I reckoned: and when I had become a man, I left unemployed the things of a child.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For now we see by a mirror in an enigma; then face to face: now I know by parts; and then shall I know as I was known.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And now remains faith, hope, love, these three; and the greater of these, love.</p>
