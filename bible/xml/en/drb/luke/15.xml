  <verse number="1">NOW the publicans and sinners drew near unto him to hear him.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying: This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And he spoke to them this parable, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="4">What man of you that hath an hundred sheep: and if he shall lose one of them, doth he not leave the ninety-nine in the desert, and go after that which was lost, until he find it?</verse>
  <verse number="5">And when he hath found it, lay it upon his shoulders, rejoicing:</verse>
  <verse number="6">And coming home, call together his friends and neighbours, saying to them: Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost?</verse>
  <verse number="7">I say to you, that even so there shall be joy in heaven upon one sinner that doth penance, more than upon ninety-nine just who need not penance.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Or what woman having ten groats; if she lose one groat, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently until she find it?</verse>
  <verse number="9">And when she hath found it, call together her friends and neighbours, saying: Rejoice with me, because I have found the groat which I had lost.</verse>
  <verse number="10">So I say to you, there shall be joy before the angels of God upon one sinner doing penance.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And he said: A certain man had two sons:</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the younger of them said to his father: Father, give me the portion of substance that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his substance.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And not many days after, the younger son, gathering all together, went abroad into a far country: and there wasted his substance, living riotously.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And after he had spent all, there came a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in want.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And he went and cleaved to one of the citizens of that country. And he sent him into his farm to feed swine.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks the swine did eat; and no man gave unto him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And returning to himself, he said: How many hired servants in my father’s house abound with bread, and I here perish with hunger?</verse>
  <verse number="18">I will arise, and will go to my father, and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee:</verse>
  <verse number="19">I am not worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And rising up he came to his father. And when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and running to him fell upon his neck, and kissed him.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And the son said to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, I am not now worthy to be called thy son.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the father said to his servants: Bring forth quickly the first robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:</verse>
  <verse number="23">And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat and make merry:</verse>
  <verse number="24">Because this my son was dead, and is come to life again: was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Now his elder son was in the field, and when he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing:</verse>
  <verse number="26">And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And he said to him: Thy brother is come, and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And he was angry, and would not go in. His father therefore coming out began to entreat him.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And he answering, said to his father: Behold, for so many years do I serve thee, and I have never transgressed thy commandment, and yet thou hast never given me a kid to make merry with my friends:</verse>
  <verse number="30">But as soon as this thy son is come, who hath devoured his substance with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.</verse>
  <verse number="31">But he said to him: Son, thou art always with me, and all I have is thine.</verse>
  <verse number="32">But it was fit that we should make merry and be glad, for this thy brother was dead and is come to life again; he was lost, and is found.</verse>
