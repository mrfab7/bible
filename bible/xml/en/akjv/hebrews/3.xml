<chapter book="Hebrews" number="3" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Why, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;</verse>
  <verse number="2">Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who has built the house has more honor than the house.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For every house is built by some man; but he that built all things is God.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Moses truly was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;</verse>
  <verse number="6">But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Why (as the Holy Ghost said, To day if you will hear his voice,</verse>
  <verse number="8">Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:</verse>
  <verse number="9">When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Why I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do always err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.</verse>
  <verse number="11">So I swore in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)</verse>
  <verse number="12">Take heed, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end;</verse>
  <verse number="15">While it is said, To day if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For some, when they had heard, did provoke: however, not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?</verse>
  <verse number="18">And to whom swore he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?</verse>
  <verse number="19">So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.</verse>
