<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Oh that thou wouldst rend the heavens, that thou wouldst come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence,\</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">As when the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to boil, to make thy name known to thy adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy presence!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">When thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, besides thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Thou meetest him that rejoiceth, and worketh righteousness, those that remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth; for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be saved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But now, O LORD, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Be not very wroth, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all thy people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Thy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned with fire: and all our pleasant things are laid waste.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O LORD? wilt thou hold thy peace, and grievously afflict us?</p>
