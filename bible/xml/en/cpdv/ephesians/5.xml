  <verse number="1">Therefore, as most beloved sons, be imitators of God.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And walk in love, just as Christ also loved us and delivered himself for us, as an oblation and a sacrifice to God, with a fragrance of sweetness.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But let not any kind of fornication, or impurity, or rapacity so much as be named among you, just as is worthy of the saints,</verse>
  <verse number="4">nor any indecent, or foolish, or abusive talk, for this is without purpose; but instead, give thanks.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For know and understand this: no one who is a fornicator, or lustful, or rapacious (for these are a kind of service to idols) holds an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Let no one seduce you with empty words. For because of these things, the wrath of God was sent upon the sons of unbelief.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Therefore, do not choose to become participants with them.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For you were darkness, in times past, but now you are light, in the Lord. So then, walk as sons of the light.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For the fruit of the light is in all goodness and justice and truth,</verse>
  <verse number="10">affirming what is well-pleasing to God.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And so, have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead, refute them.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For the things that are done by them in secret are shameful, even to mention.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But all things that are disputed are made manifest by the light. For all that is made manifest is light.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Because of this, it is said: “You who are sleeping: awaken, and rise up from the dead, and so shall the Christ enlighten you.”</verse>
  <verse number="15">And so, brothers, see to it that you walk cautiously, not like the foolish,</verse>
  <verse number="16">but like the wise: atoning for this age, because this is an evil time.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For this reason, do not choose to be imprudent. Instead, understand what is the will of God.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And do not choose to be inebriated by wine, for this is self-indulgence. Instead, be filled with the Holy Spirit,</verse>
  <verse number="19">speaking among yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual canticles, singing and reciting psalms to the Lord in your hearts,</verse>
  <verse number="20">giving thanks always for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God the Father.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Be subject to one another in the fear of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Wives should be submissive to their husbands, as to the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For the husband is the head of the wife, just as Christ is the head of the Church. He is the Savior of his body.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Therefore, just as the Church is subject to Christ, so also should wives be subject to their husbands in all things.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the Church and handed himself over for her,</verse>
  <verse number="26">so that he might sanctify her, washing her clean by water and the Word of life,</verse>
  <verse number="27">so that he might offer her to himself as a glorious Church, not having any spot or wrinkle or any such thing, so that she would be holy and immaculate.</verse>
  <verse number="28">So, too, husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For no man has ever hated his own flesh, but instead he nourishes and cherishes it, as Christ also does to the Church.</verse>
  <verse number="30">For we are a part of his body, of his flesh and of his bones.</verse>
  <verse number="31">“For this reason, a man shall leave behind his father and mother, and he shall cling to his wife; and the two shall be as one flesh.”</verse>
  <verse number="32">This is a great Sacrament. And I am speaking in Christ and in the Church.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Yet truly, each and every one of you should love his wife as himself. And a wife should fear her husband.</verse>
