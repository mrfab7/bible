<p class="verse" data-verse="1">At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of its place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hearken ye unto the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">He sendeth it forth under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">After it a voice roareth; he thundereth with the voice of his majesty: and he stayeth them not when his voice is heard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">God thundereth marvelously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For he saith to the snow, Fall thou on the earth; likewise to the shower of rain, and to the showers of his mighty rain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men whom he hath made may know it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Then the beasts go into coverts, and remain in their dens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Out of the chamber of the south cometh the storm: and cold out of the north.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">By the breath of God ice is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Yea, he ladeth the thick cloud with moisture; he spreadeth abroad the cloud of his lightning:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And it is turned round about by his guidance, that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the habitable world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Whether it be for correction, or for his land, or for mercy, that he cause it to come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Dost thou know how God layeth his charge upon them, and causeth the lightning of his cloud to shine?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">How thy garments are warm, when the earth is still by reason of the south wind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Canst thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong as a molten mirror?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Shall it be told him that I would speak? or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And now men see not the light which is bright in the skies: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Out of the north cometh golden splendour: God hath upon him terrible majesty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Touching the Almighty, we can not find him out; he is excellent in power: and in judgment and plenteous justice he will not afflict.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Men do therefore fear him: he regardeth not any that are wise of heart.</p>
