<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Hear ye now what Jehovah said: Arise, contend thou with the mountains, and the hills shall hear thy voice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hear ye mountains the contention of Jehovah, and ye perpetual foundations of the earth: for a contention to Jehovah with his people, and he will dispute with Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">My people, what did I to thee? and in what did I weary thee? answer to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For I brought thee up from the land of Egypt, and from the house of servants I redeemed thee; and I shall send before thy face, Moses, Aaron and, Miriam.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab counseled, and what Balaam son of Beor answered him from the acacias even to Gilgal; in order to know the justice of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">With what shall I come before Jehovah? I will bow to the high God; shall I come before him with burnt-offerings, with calves, the sons of a year?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Will Jehovah delight in thousands of rams, in ten thousands of torrents of oil? shall I give my first-born my transgression? the fruit of my belly, the sin of my soul?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He announced to thee, O man, what was good; and what did Jehovah require of thee but to do judgment and to love mercy, and being humbled, to go with thy God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The voice of Jehovah will call to the city, and wisdom feared thy name: hear ye the rod, and who appointed it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Are there yet treasures of injustice in the house of the unjust, and the ephah of leanness being cursed?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Shall I make clean with the balances of injustice, and with the bag of stones of deceit?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For her rich ones were full of violence, and her inhabitants spake falsehood, and their tongue of deceit in their mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And also I made sick, striking thee, making desolate for thy sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Thou shalt eat and not be satisfied; and thine emptiness in the midst of thee; and thou shalt remove and shalt not deliver; and what thou shalt save I will give to the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Thou shalt sow and thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olive and thou shalt not anoint thyself with oil; and new wine, and thou shalt not drink wine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The laws of Omri will be observed, and all the work of the house of Ahab, and ye will go in their counsels; so that I shall give thee for a desolation, and her inhabitants for hissing, and ye shall bear the reproach of my People.</p>
