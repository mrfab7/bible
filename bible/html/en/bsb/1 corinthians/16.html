<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now about the collection for the saints, you are to do as I directed the churches of Galatia:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">On the first day of every week, each of you should set aside a portion of his income, saving it up, so that when I come no collections will be needed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Then, on my arrival, I will send letters with those you recommend to carry your gift to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And if it is advisable for me to go also, they can travel with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">After I go through Macedonia, however, I will come to you; for I will be going through Macedonia.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Perhaps I will stay with you awhile, or even spend the winter, so that you can help me on my journey, wherever I go.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For I do not want to see you now only in passing; I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">because a great door for effective work has opened to me, even though many oppose me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">If Timothy comes, see to it that he has nothing to fear while he is with you, for he is doing the work of the Lord, just as I am.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">No one, then, should treat him with contempt. Send him on his way in peace so that he can return to me, for I am expecting him along with the brothers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Now about our brother Apollos: I strongly urged him to go to you with the brothers. He was not at all inclined to go now, but he will go when he has the opportunity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Be on the alert. Stand firm in the faith. Be men of courage. Be strong.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Do everything in love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">You know that Stephanas and his household were the first converts in Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints. Now I urge you, brothers,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">to submit to such as these, and to every fellow worker and laborer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I am glad that Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus have arrived, because they have supplied what was lacking from you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For they refreshed my spirit and yours as well. Show your appreciation, therefore, to such men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The churches in the province of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Prisca greet you warmly in the Lord, and so does the church that meets at their house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">All the brothers here send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">This greeting is in my own handâ€”Paul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">If anyone does not love the Lord, let him be under a curse. Come, O Lord!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">My love be with all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.</p>
