<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And in the day of Pentecost being completed, they were all unanimously in one and the same place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And suddenly was a sound from heaven as of a wind moving violently, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And seen to them were tongues divided as fire, and it sat upon each one of them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in other tongues, as the Spirit gave them to utter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, circumspect men, from every nation of those under heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And there having been this voice, the multitude came together, and were disturbed, for each one heard them speaking in his own dialect.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And all were affected in mind and wondered, saying to one another, Behold, are not these speaking Galileans.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And how hear we each in our own dialect, in which we were born?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and they dwelling in Mesopotamia, and Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus, and Asia,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And Phrygia, and Pamphylia, Egypt, and parts of Lybia that near Cyrene, and Romans arriving as strangers, and Jews, and strangers,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Cretes and Arabians, we hear them speaking in our tongues the great things of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And all were affected in mind, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What may this mean to be?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And others mocking said, That they are filled with new wine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Peter, having stood with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said to them, Men Jews, and all ye dwelling in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and hear ye my words:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For not, as ye suppose, are these intoxicated, (for it is the third hour of the day.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But this is that spoken by the prophet Joel;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And it shall be in the last days, says God, I pour out from my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your elder dream dreams:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And also upon my servants and upon my maids in those days will I pour out from my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And I will give wonders in heaven above, and signs upon the earth below; blood, and fire, and steam of smoke:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and distinguished day of the Lord come:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And it shall be, every one, who shall call on the name of the Lord, shall be saved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Men, Israelites, bear these words; Jesus the Nazarite, a man elected by God for you by powers and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, (as also ye yourselves know:)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">This one, surrendered by the fixed counsel and foreknowledge of God, having taken by lawless hands, having fastened, ye slew:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Whom God raised up, having loosed the pains of death: as it was not possible for him to be holden of it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For David says about him, I saw beforehand the Lord before me always, for he is of my right hand, that I be not moved:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For this my heart was gladdened, and my tongue was transported with joy; and yet also shall my flesh encamp in hope:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For thou wilt not leave my soul in hades neither wilt thou give thy sanctified one to see corruption.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou wilt fill me with gladness with thy face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Men, brethren, it is permitted to speak with freedom of speech to you of the patriarch David, for he died and was buried, and his tomb is with us even till this day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God swore with an oath to him, of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, to raise up Christ to sit upon his throne:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Foreknowing, he spake of the rising up of Christ, that his soul was not left in hades, neither did his flesh see corruption.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">This Jesus God raised up, of which all we are witnesses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Therefore exalted by the right hand of God, and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, he poured out this, which ye now see and hear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">For David ascended not into the heavens: and he himself says, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit from my right hand,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Even till I set thine enemies the footstool of thy feet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Therefore let all the house of Israel know certainly, that God made him Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom ye crucified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And having heard, they were pricked in heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the sent, What shall we do, men, brethren?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And Peter said to them, Repent, and be each of you immersed in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all afar off, as many as the Lord our God should call.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And with many other words he appealed earnestly and besought, saying, Be ye saved from this crooked generation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Then truly they having gladly received his word were immersed: and in that day were added about three thousand souls.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">And they were persevering in the teaching of the sent, and in mutual participation, and breaking of bread, and prayers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">And to every soul was fear: and through the sent were many wonders and signs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">And all believing were in one and the same place, and had all things common:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">And sold possessions and goods, and divided them to all, as any one had need.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">And in the day persevering unanimously in the temple, and breaking bread in the house, they partook of food with lively joy and simplicity of heart,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">Praising God, and having favor with the whole people. And in the day the Lord added the saved to the church.</p>
