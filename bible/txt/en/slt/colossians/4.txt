1	Lords, render ye to servants Justice and equality; knowing that ye also have a Lord in the heavens.
2	In prayer persevere, watching in it in gratitude.
3	Praying together also for us, that God would open to us a door of the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, by which also I was bound;
4	That I might manifest, as is fitting for me to speak.
5	In wisdom walk toward them without, purchasing the time.
6	Your word always in grace, Seasoned with salt, to know how it is fitting for you to answer one another.
7	All things concerning me shall Tychicus make known to you, a dearly beloved brother, and a faithful servant and fellowservant in the Lord:
8	Whom I sent to you for this same, that he might know the things concerning you, and comfort your hearts;
9	With Onesimus, the faithful and dearly beloved brother, who is of you. They shall make known to you all the thing here.
10	Aristarchus my fellowcaptive greets you, and Marcus, sisterâ€™s son to Barnabas, (for whom ye received commands: if he come to you, receive him;)
11	And Jesus, called Justus, they being of the circumcision. These only fellow workers in the kingdom of God, which were a consolation to me.
12	Epaphras, who of you, greets you, a servant of Christ, always contending for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfected and completed in all the will of God.
13	For I bear testimony to him, that he has much zeal for you, and for them in Laodicea, and for them in Hierapolis.
14	Luke, the dearly beloved physician, greets you, and Demas.
15	Greet the brethren in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church in his house.
16	And when the epistle shall be read among you, make that also it be read to the church in Laodicea; and that ye also read that from Laodicea.
17	And say to Archippus, Look out for the service which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fill it.
18	The greeting of Paul by my hand. Remember my bonds. Grace with you. Amen.
