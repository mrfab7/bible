<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Every wise woman buildeth her house; But the foolish plucketh it down with her hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD; But he that is perverse in his ways despiseth Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride; But the lips of the wise shall preserve them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Where no oxen are, the crib is clean; But much increase is by the strength of the ox.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">A faithful witness will not lie; But a false witness breatheth forth lies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not; But knowledge is easy unto him that hath discernment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Go from the presence of a foolish man, for thou wilt not perceive the lips of knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The wisdom of the prudent is to look well to his way; But the folly of fools is deceit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Amends pleadeth for fools; But among the upright there is good will.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The heart knoweth its own bitterness; And with its joy no stranger can intermeddle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The house of the wicked shall be overthrown; But the tent of the upright shall flourish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, But the end thereof are the ways of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Even in laughter the heart acheth; And the end of mirth is heaviness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The dissembler in heart shall have his fill from his own ways; And a good man shall be satisfied from himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The thoughtless believeth every word; But the prudent man looketh well to his going.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil; But the fool behaveth overbearingly, and is confident.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly; And a man of wicked devices is hated.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The thoughtless come into possession of folly; But the prudent are crowned with knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The evil bow before the good, And the wicked at the gates of the righteous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The poor is hated even of his own neighbour; But the rich hath many friends.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth; But he that is gracious unto the humble, happy is he.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Shall they not go astray that devise evil? But mercy and truth shall be for them that devise good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">In all labour there is profit; But the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The crown of the wise is their riches; But the folly of fools remaineth folly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">A true witness delivereth souls; But he that breatheth forth lies is all deceit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">In the fear of the LORD a man hath strong confidence; And his children shall have a place of refuge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">In the multitude of people is the king’s glory; But in the want of people is the ruin of the prince.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">He that is slow to anger is of great understanding; But he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">A tranquil heart is the life of the flesh; But envy is the rottenness of the bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">He that oppresseth the poor blasphemeth his Maker; But he that is gracious unto the needy honoureth Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">The wicked is thrust down in his misfortune; But the righteous, even when he is brought to death, hath hope.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">In the heart of him that hath discernment wisdom resteth; But in the inward part of fools it maketh itself known.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Righteousness exalteth a nation; But sin is a reproach to any people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">The king’s favour is toward a servant that dealeth wisely; But his wrath striketh him that dealeth shamefully.</p>
