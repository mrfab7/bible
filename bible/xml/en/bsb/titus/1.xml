<chapter book="Titus" number="1" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ for the faith of God’s elect and their knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness,</verse>
  <verse number="2">in the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before time began.</verse>
  <verse number="3">In His own time He has made His word evident in the proclamation entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior.</verse>
  <verse number="4">To Titus, my true child in our common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.</verse>
  <verse number="5">The reason I left you in Crete was that you would set in order what was unfinished and appoint elders in every town, as I directed you.</verse>
  <verse number="6">An elder must be blameless, the husband of but one wife, having children who are believers and who are not open to accusation of indiscretion or insubordination.</verse>
  <verse number="7">As God’s steward, an overseer must be above reproach—not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent, not greedy for money.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Instead, he must be hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, upright, holy, and disciplined.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He must hold firmly to the faithful word as it was taught, so that he can encourage others by sound teaching and refute those who contradict it.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For many are rebellious and full of empty talk and deception, especially those of the circumcision,</verse>
  <verse number="11">who must be silenced. For the sake of dishonorable gain, they undermine entire households and teach things they should not.</verse>
  <verse number="12">As one of their own prophets has said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.”</verse>
  <verse number="13">This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them sternly, so that they will be sound in the faith</verse>
  <verse number="14">and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the commands of men who have rejected the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="15">To the pure, all things are pure; but to the defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure. Indeed, both their minds and their consciences are defiled.</verse>
  <verse number="16">They profess to know God, but by their actions they deny Him. They are detestable, disobedient, and unfit for any good deed.</verse>
