<chapter book="Job" number="14" translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" translationID="cpdv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Man, born of woman, living for a short time, is filled with many miseries.</verse>
  <verse number="2">He comes forth like a flower, and is crushed, and he flees, as if a shadow, and never remains in the same state.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And do you consider it fitting to look down with your eyes on someone in this way and to lead him into judgment with you?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Who can make him clean who is conceived of unclean seed? Are you not the only one who can?</verse>
  <verse number="5">The days of man are short, and the number of his months is with you; you have determined his limits, which cannot be surpassed.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Withdraw a little from him, so that he may rest, until his awaited day arrives, like that of the hired hand.</verse>
  <verse number="7">A tree has hope: if it has been cut, it turns green again, and its branches spring forth.</verse>
  <verse number="8">If its roots grow old in the earth, and its trunk passes into dust,</verse>
  <verse number="9">at the scent of water, it will sprout and bring forth leaves, as when it had first been planted.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Truly, when a man dies, and has been left unprotected, and has decayed, I ask you where is he?</verse>
  <verse number="11">It is as if the waters had receded from the sea and an emptied river had dried up;</verse>
  <verse number="12">just so, when a man is fallen asleep, he will not rise again, until the heavens are worn away; he will not awaken, nor rise from his sleep.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Who will grant this to me, that you will protect me in the underworld, and hide me until your fury passes by, and establish a time for me, in which you will remember me?</verse>
  <verse number="14">Do you suppose that a dead man will live again? On each of the days in which I now battle, I wait until my transformation occurs.</verse>
  <verse number="15">You will call me and I will answer you; to the work of your hands, you will extend your right hand.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Indeed, you have numbered my steps, but you have been lenient with my sins.</verse>
  <verse number="17">You have sealed up my offenses, as if in a purse, but you have cured my iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="18">A falling mountain flows away, and a stone is transferred from its place.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Waters wear away stones, and with a flood the land is reduced little by little; and similarly, you will destroy man.</verse>
  <verse number="20">You have strengthened him for a little while, so that he may cross over into eternity. You will change his face and send him forth.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Whether his sons have been noble or ignoble, he will not understand.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And in this way his body, while he yet lives, will have grief, and his soul will mourn over himself.</verse>
