  <verse number="1">BEFORE the festival day of the pasch, Jesus knowing that his hour was come, that he should pass out of this world to the Father: having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them unto the end.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And when supper was done, (the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray him,)</verse>
  <verse number="3">Knowing that the Father had given him all things into his hands, and that he came from God, and goeth to God;</verse>
  <verse number="4">He riseth from supper, and layeth aside his garments, and having taken a towel, girded himself.</verse>
  <verse number="5">After that, he putteth water into a basin, and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.</verse>
  <verse number="6">He cometh therefore to Simon Peter. And Peter saith to him: Lord, dost thou wash my feet?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Jesus answered, and said to him: What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Peter saith to him: Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him: If I wash thee not, thou shalt have no part with me.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Simon Peter saith to him: Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and my head.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Jesus saith to him: He that is washed, needeth not but to wash his feet, but is clean wholly. And you are clean, but not all.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For he knew who he was that would betray him; therefore he said: You are not all clean.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Then after he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, being set down again, he said to them: Know you what I have done to you?</verse>
  <verse number="13">You call me Master, and Lord; and you say well, for so I am.</verse>
  <verse number="14">If then I being your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; you also ought to wash one another’s feet.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For I have given you an example, that as I have done to you, so you do also.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Amen, amen I say to you: The servant is not greater than his lord; neither is the apostle greater than he that sent him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">If you know these things, you shall be blessed if you do them.</verse>
  <verse number="18">I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen. But that the scripture may be fulfilled: He that eateth bread with me, shall lift up his heel against me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">At present I tell you, before it come to pass: that when it shall come to pass, you may believe that I am he.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Amen, amen I say to you, he that receiveth whomsoever I send, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="21">When Jesus had said these things, he was troubled in spirit; and he testified, and said: Amen, amen I say to you, one of you shall betray me.</verse>
  <verse number="22">The disciples therefore looked one upon another, doubting of whom he spoke.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Now there was leaning on Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, and said to him: Who is it of whom he speaketh?</verse>
  <verse number="25">He therefore, leaning on the breast of Jesus, saith to him: Lord, who is it?</verse>
  <verse number="26">Jesus answered: He it is to whom I shall reach bread dipped. And when he had dipped the bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And after the morsel, Satan entered into him. And Jesus said to him: That which thou dost, do quickly.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Now no man at the table knew to what purpose he said this unto him.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For some thought, because Judas had the purse, that Jesus had said to him: Buy those things which we have need of for the festival day: or that he should give something to the poor.</verse>
  <verse number="30">He therefore having received the morsel, went out immediately. And it was night.</verse>
  <verse number="31">When he therefore was gone out, Jesus said: Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.</verse>
  <verse number="32">If God be glorified in him, God also will glorify him in himself; and immediately will he glorify him.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You shall seek me; and as I said to the Jews: Whither I go you cannot come; so I say to you now.</verse>
  <verse number="34">A new commandment I give unto you: That you love one another, as I have loved you, that you also love one another.</verse>
  <verse number="35">By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love one for another.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Simon Peter saith to him: Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered: Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow hereafter.</verse>
  <verse number="37">Peter saith to him: Why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thee.</verse>
  <verse number="38">Jesus answered him: Wilt thou lay down thy life for me? Amen, amen I say to thee, the cock shall not crow, till thou deny me thrice.</verse>
