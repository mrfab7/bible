  <verse number="5">Come, eat my bread, and drink the wine which I have mingled for you.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Forsake childishness, and live, and walk by the ways of prudence.</verse>
  <verse number="7">He that teacheth a scorner, doth an injury to himself: and he that rebuketh a wicked man, getteth himself a blot.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Rebuke not a scorner lest he hate thee. Rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.</verse>
