<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of Neriah, when he wrote these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, unto thee, O Baruch:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for Jehovah hath added sorrow to my pain; I am weary with my groaning, and I find no rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thus shalt thou say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, that which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up; and this in the whole land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not; for, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith Jehovah; but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest.</p>
