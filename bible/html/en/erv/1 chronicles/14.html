<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and masons, and carpenters, to build him an house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, for his kingdom was exalted on high, for his people Israelâ€™s sake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And these are the names of the children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David: and David heard of it, and went out against them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">So they came up to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and David said, God hath broken mine enemies by mine hand, like the breach of waters. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And they left their gods there; and David gave commandment, and they were burned with fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And the Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And David inquired again of God; and God said unto him, Thou shalt not go up after them: turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And David did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the fame of David went out unto all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations.</p>
