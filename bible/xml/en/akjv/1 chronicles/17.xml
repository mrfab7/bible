<chapter book="1 Chronicles" number="17" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, See, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD remains under curtains.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Then Nathan said to David, Do all that is in your heart; for God is with you.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="4">Go and tell David my servant, Thus said the LORD, You shall not build me an house to dwell in:</verse>
  <verse number="5">For I have not dwelled in an house since the day that I brought up Israel to this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Wherever I have walked with all Israel, spoke I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have you not built me an house of cedars?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Now therefore thus shall you say to my servant David, Thus said the LORD of hosts, I took you from the sheepcote, even from following the sheep, that you should be ruler over my people Israel:</verse>
  <verse number="8">And I have been with you wherever you have walked, and have cut off all your enemies from before you, and have made you a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning,</verse>
  <verse number="10">And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all your enemies. Furthermore I tell you that the LORD will build you an house.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And it shall come to pass, when your days be expired that you must go to be with your fathers, that I will raise up your seed after you, which shall be of your sons; and I will establish his kingdom.</verse>
  <verse number="12">He shall build me an house, and I will establish his throne for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="13">I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before you:</verse>
  <verse number="14">But I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for ever more.</verse>
  <verse number="15">According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my house, that you have brought me till now?</verse>
  <verse number="17">And yet this was a small thing in your eyes, O God; for you have also spoken of your servant’s house for a great while to come, and have regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God.</verse>
  <verse number="18">What can David speak more to you for the honor of your servant? for you know your servant.</verse>
  <verse number="19">O LORD, for your servant’s sake, and according to your own heart, have you done all this greatness, in making known all these great things.</verse>
  <verse number="20">O LORD, there is none like you, neither is there any God beside you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And what one nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make you a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before your people whom you have redeemed out of Egypt?</verse>
  <verse number="22">For your people Israel did you make your own people for ever; and you, LORD, became their God.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that you have spoken concerning your servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as you have said.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Let it even be established, that your name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and let the house of David your servant be established before you.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For you, O my God, have told your servant that you will build him an house: therefore your servant has found in his heart to pray before you.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And now, LORD, you are God, and have promised this goodness to your servant:</verse>
  <verse number="27">Now therefore let it please you to bless the house of your servant, that it may be before you for ever: for you bless, O LORD, and it shall be blessed for ever.</verse>
