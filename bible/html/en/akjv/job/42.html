<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="42" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered the LORD, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I know that you can do every thing, and that no thought can be withheld from you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Who is he that hides counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Hear, I beseech you, and I will speak: I will demand of you, and declare you to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I have heard of you by the hearing of the ear: but now my eye sees you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Why I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words to Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against you, and against your two friends: for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Therefore take to you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that you have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Then came there to him all his brothers, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought on him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He had also seven sons and three daughters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brothers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, even four generations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">So Job died, being old and full of days.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="1195">Psalm 78:4	We will not hide them from their children, showing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he has done.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1196">Psalm 78:5	For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1197">Psalm 78:6	That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="1203">Psalm 78:12	Marvelous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1204">Psalm 78:13	He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="1213">Psalm 78:22	Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1214">Psalm 78:23	Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1215">Psalm 78:24	And had rained down manna on them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1216">Psalm 78:25	Man did eat angels’ food: he sent them meat to the full.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1217">Psalm 78:26	He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1218">Psalm 78:27	He rained flesh also on them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1219">Psalm 78:28	And he let it fall in the middle of their camp, round about their habitations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1220">Psalm 78:29	So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="1224">Psalm 78:33	Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1225">Psalm 78:34	When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and inquired early after God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1226">Psalm 78:35	And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1227">Psalm 78:36	Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied to him with their tongues.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1228">Psalm 78:37	For their heart was not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his covenant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1229">Psalm 78:38	But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yes, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="1233">Psalm 78:42	They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1234">Psalm 78:43	How he had worked his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1235">Psalm 78:44	And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1236">Psalm 78:45	He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1237">Psalm 78:46	He gave also their increase to the caterpillar, and their labor to the locust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1238">Psalm 78:47	He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1239">Psalm 78:48	He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1240">Psalm 78:49	He cast on them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1241">Psalm 78:50	He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1242">Psalm 78:51	And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1243">Psalm 78:52	But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1244">Psalm 78:53	And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1245">Psalm 78:54	And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1246">Psalm 78:55	He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1247">Psalm 78:56	Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1248">Psalm 78:57	But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1249">Psalm 78:58	For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1250">Psalm 78:59	When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1251">Psalm 78:60	So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1252">Psalm 78:61	And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy’s hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1253">Psalm 78:62	He gave his people over also to the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1254">Psalm 78:63	The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1255">Psalm 78:64	Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1256">Psalm 78:65	Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouts by reason of wine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1257">Psalm 78:66	And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1258">Psalm 78:67	Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1259">Psalm 78:68	But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1260">Psalm 78:69	And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he has established for ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1261">Psalm 78:70	He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1262">Psalm 78:71	From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1263">Psalm 78:72	So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="1264">Psalm 79:1	O God, the heathen are come into your inheritance; your holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.</p>
