<p class="verse" data-verse="1">These also are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the glory of kings is to search out a matter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Take away the dross from the silver, and there cometh forth a vessel for the finer:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Put not thyself forward in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For better is it that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince, whom thine eyes have seen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself, and disclose not the secret of another:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Lest he that heareth it revile thee, and thine infamy turn not away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in baskets of silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them that send him; for he refresheth the soul of his masters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">As clouds and wind without rain, so is he that boasteth himself of his gifts falsely.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">By long forbearing is a ruler persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee; lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Let thy foot be seldom in thy neighbourâ€™s house; lest he be weary of thee, and hate thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">As one that taketh off a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The north wind bringeth forth rain: so doth a backbiting tongue an angry countenance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">It is better to dwell in the comer of the housetop, than with a contentious woman in a wide house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">As a troubled fountain, and a corrupted spring, so is a righteous man that giveth way before the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search out their own glory is not glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">He whose spirit is without restraint is like a city that is broken down and hath no wall.</p>
