<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And again I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between the two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grizzled bay horses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Then I answered and said unto the angel that spoke with me: ‘What are these, my lord?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the angel answered and said unto me: ‘These chariots go forth to the four winds of heaven, after presenting themselves before the Lord of all the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">That wherein are the black horses goeth forth toward the north country; and the white went forth after them; and the grizzled went forth toward the south country;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">and the bay went forth’. And they sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth; and he said: ‘Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth.’ So they walked to and fro through the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Then cried he upon me, and spoke unto me, saying: ‘Behold, they that go toward the north country have eased My spirit in the north country.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, that are come from Babylon; and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">yea, take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set the one upon the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">and speak unto him, saying: Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying: Behold, a man whose name is the Shoot, and who shall shoot up out of his place, and build the temple of the LORD;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and there shall be a priest before his throne; and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, as a memorial in the temple of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you. And it shall come to pass, if ye will diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD your God—.’</p>
