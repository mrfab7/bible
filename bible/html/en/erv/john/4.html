<p class="verse" data-verse="1">When therefore the Lord knew how that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">(although Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples),</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">he left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And he must needs pass through Samaria.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">So he cometh to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and Jacobâ€™s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The Samaritan woman therefore saith unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a Samaritan woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his sons, and his cattle?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Jesus answered and said unto her, Every one that drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up unto eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come all the way hither to draw.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The woman answered and said unto him, I have no husband. Jesus saith unto her, Thou saidst well, I have no husband:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: this hast thou said truly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Ye worship that which ye know not: we worship that which we know: for salvation is from the Jews.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth: for such doth the Father seek to be his worshippers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship in spirit and truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah cometh (which is called Christ): when he is come, he will declare unto us all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And upon this came his disciples; and they marveled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">So the woman left her waterpot, and went away into the city, and saith to the men,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: can this be the Christ?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">They went out of the city, and were coming to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">In the mean while the disciples prayed him, saying, Rabbi, eat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">The disciples therefore said one to another, Hath any man brought him aught to eat?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to accomplish his work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh the harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, that they are white already unto harvest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">He that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal; that he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">For herein is the saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">I sent you to reap that whereon ye have not laboured: others have laboured, and ye are entered into their labour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And from that city many of the Samaritans believed on him because of the word of the woman, who testified, He told me all things that ever I did.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">So when the Samaritans came unto him, they besought him to abide with them: and he abode there two days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">And many more believed because of his word;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">and they said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy speaking: for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">And after the two days he went forth from thence into Galilee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">So when he came into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">He came therefore again unto Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">Jesus therefore said unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will in no wise believe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. The man believed the word that Jesus spake unto him, and he went his way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">And as he was now going down, his servants met him, saying, that his son lived.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="52">So he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend. They said therefore unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="54">This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judaea into Galilee.</p>
