<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And thou—be speaking what doth become the sound teaching;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">aged men to be temperate, grave, sober, sound in the faith, in the love, in the endurance;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">aged women, in like manner, in deportment as doth become sacred persons, not false accusers, to much wine not enslaved, of good things teachers,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">that they may make the young women sober-minded, to be lovers of their husbands, lovers of their children,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">sober, pure, keepers of their own houses, good, subject to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be evil spoken of.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The younger men, in like manner, be exhorting to be sober-minded;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">concerning all things thyself showing a pattern of good works; in the teaching uncorruptedness, gravity, incorruptibility,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">discourse sound, irreprehensible, that he who is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say concerning you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Servants—to their own masters are to be subject, in all things to be well-pleasing, not gainsaying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">not purloining, but showing all good stedfastness, that the teaching of God our Saviour they may adorn in all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For the saving grace of God was manifested to all men,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">teaching us, that denying the impiety and the worldly desires, soberly and righteously and piously we may live in the present age,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">waiting for the blessed hope and manifestation of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">who did give himself for us, that he might ransom us from all lawlessness, and might purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">these things be speaking, and exhorting, and convicting, with all charge; let no one despise thee!</p>
