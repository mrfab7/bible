<div class="chapter" data-book="Isaiah" data-chapter="6" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Above it stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he did fly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And one cried to another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the middle of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Then flew one of the seraphim to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And he laid it on my mouth, and said, See, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin purged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear you indeed, but understand not; and see you indeed, but perceive not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And the LORD have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the middle of the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.</p>
