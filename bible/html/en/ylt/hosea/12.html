<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Ephraim is enjoying wind, And is pursuing an east wind, All the day lying and spoiling he multiplieth, And a covenant with Asshur they make, And oil to Egypt is carried.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And a controversy hath Jehovah with Judah, To lay a charge on Jacob according to his ways, According to his doings He returneth to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">In the womb he took his brother by the heel, And by his strength he was a prince with God,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Yea, he is a prince unto the Messenger, And he overcometh by weeping, And he maketh supplication to Him, At Bethel He doth find him, And there He doth speak with us,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Even Jehovah, God of the Hosts, Jehovah is His memorial.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And thou, through thy God, dost turn, Kindness and judgment keep thou, And wait on thy God continually.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Canaan! in his hand are balances of deceit! To oppress he hath loved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Ephraim saith: ‘Surely I have become rich, I have found wealth for myself, All my labours—they find not against me iniquity that is sin.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And I—Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt, Again do I turn thee back into tents, As in the days of the appointed time.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And I have spoken unto the prophets, And I have multiplied vision, And by the hand of the prophets I use similes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Surely Gilead is iniquity, Only, vanity they have been, In Gilead bullocks they have sacrificed, Also their altars are as heaps, on the furrows of a field.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And Jacob doth flee to the country of Aram, And Israel doth serve for a wife, Yea, for a wife he hath kept watch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And by a prophet hath Jehovah brought up Israel out of Egypt, And by a prophet it hath been watched.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Ephraim hath provoked most bitterly, And his blood on himself he leaveth, And his reproach turn back to him doth his Lord!</p>
