<chapter book="Hosea" number="4" translation="American Standard Version" translationID="asv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Hear the word of Jehovah, ye children of Israel; for Jehovah hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor goodness, nor knowledge of God in the land.</verse>
  <verse number="2">There is nought but swearing and breaking faith, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery; they break out, and blood toucheth blood.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Yet let no man strive, neither let any man reprove; for thy people are as they that strive with the priest.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And thou shalt stumble in the day, and the prophet also shall stumble with thee in the night; and I will destroy thy mother.</verse>
  <verse number="6">My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy children.</verse>
  <verse number="7">As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me: I will change their glory into shame.</verse>
  <verse number="8">They feed on the sin of my people, and set their heart on their iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And it shall be, like people, like priest; and I will punish them for their ways, and will requite them their doings.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And they shall eat, and not have enough; they shall play the harlot, and shall not increase; because they have left off taking heed to Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="12">My people ask counsel at their stock, and their staff declareth unto them; for the spirit of whoredom hath caused them to err, and they have played the harlot, departing from under their God.</verse>
  <verse number="13">They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinths, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters play the harlot, and your brides commit adultery.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I will not punish your daughters when they play the harlot, nor your brides when they commit adultery; for the men themselves go apart with harlots, and they sacrifice with the prostitutes; and the people that doth not understand shall be overthrown.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear, As Jehovah liveth.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For Israel hath behaved himself stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer: now will Jehovah feed them as a lamb in a large place.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Their drink is become sour; they play the harlot continually; her rulers dearly love shame.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The wind hath wrapped her up in its wings; and they shall be put to shame because of their sacrifices.</verse>
