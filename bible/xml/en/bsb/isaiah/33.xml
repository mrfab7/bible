  <verse number="1">Woe to you, O destroyer never destroyed, O traitor never betrayed! When you have finished destroying, you will be destroyed. When you have finished betraying, you will be betrayed.</verse>
  <verse number="2">O LORD, be gracious to us! We wait for You. Be our strength every morning and our salvation in time of trouble.</verse>
  <verse number="3">The peoples flee the thunder of Your voice; the nations scatter when You rise.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Your spoil, O nations, is gathered as by locusts; like a swarm of locusts men sweep over it.</verse>
  <verse number="5">The LORD is exalted, for He dwells on high; He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="6">He will be the sure foundation for your times, a storehouse of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge. The fear of the LORD is Zion’s treasure.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Behold, their valiant ones cry aloud in the streets; the envoys of peace weep bitterly.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The highways are deserted; travel has ceased. The treaty has been broken, the witnesses are despised, and human life is disregarded.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The land mourns and languishes; Lebanon is ashamed and decayed. Sharon is like a desert; Bashan and Carmel shake off their leaves.</verse>
  <verse number="10">“Now I will arise,” says the LORD. “Now I will lift Myself up. Now I will be exalted.</verse>
  <verse number="11">You conceive chaff; you give birth to stubble. Your breath is a fire that will consume you.</verse>
  <verse number="12">The peoples will be burned to ashes, like thorns cut down and set ablaze.</verse>
  <verse number="13">You who are far off, hear what I have done; you who are near, acknowledge My might.”</verse>
  <verse number="14">The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling grips the ungodly: “Who of us can dwell with a consuming fire? Who of us can dwell with everlasting flames?”</verse>
  <verse number="15">He who walks righteously and speaks with sincerity, who refuses gain from extortion, whose hand never takes a bribe, who stops his ears against murderous plots and shuts his eyes tightly against evil—</verse>
  <verse number="16">he will dwell on the heights; the mountain fortress will be his refuge; his food will be provided and his water assured.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Your eyes will see the King in His beauty and behold a land that stretches afar.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Your mind will ponder the former terror: “Where is he who tallies? Where is he who weighs? Where is he who counts the towers?”</verse>
  <verse number="19">You will no longer see the insolent, a people whose speech is unintelligible, who stammer in a language you cannot understand.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Look upon Zion, the city of our appointed feasts. Your eyes will see Jerusalem, a peaceful pasture, a tent that does not wander; its tent pegs will not be pulled up, nor will any of its cords be broken.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But there the Majestic One, our LORD, will be for us a place of rivers and wide canals, where no galley with oars will row, and no majestic vessel will pass.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For the LORD is our Judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is our King. It is He who will save us.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Your ropes are slack; they cannot secure the mast or spread the sail. Then an abundance of spoils will be divided, and even the lame will carry off plunder.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And no resident of Zion will say, “I am sick.” The people who dwell there will be forgiven of iniquity.</verse>
