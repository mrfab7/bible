<chapter book="John" number="4" translation="King James Bible" translationID="kjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,</verse>
  <verse number="2">(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)</verse>
  <verse number="3">He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he must needs go through Samaria.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with [his] journey, sat thus on the well: [and] it was about the sixth hour.</verse>
  <verse number="7">There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.</verse>
  <verse number="8">(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?</verse>
  <verse number="13">Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</verse>
  <verse number="14">But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</verse>
  <verse number="17">The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:</verse>
  <verse number="18">For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.</verse>
  <verse number="24">God [is] a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship [him] in spirit and in truth.</verse>
  <verse number="25">The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am [he].</verse>
  <verse number="27">And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?</verse>
  <verse number="28">The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,</verse>
  <verse number="29">Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?</verse>
  <verse number="30">Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.</verse>
  <verse number="31">In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.</verse>
  <verse number="32">But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him [ought] to eat?</verse>
  <verse number="34">Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Say not ye, There are yet four months, and [then] cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</verse>
  <verse number="38">I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.</verse>
  <verse number="40">So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And many more believed because of his own word;</verse>
  <verse number="42">And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard [him] ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="43">Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.</verse>
  <verse number="44">For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.</verse>
  <verse number="45">Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.</verse>
  <verse number="46">So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</verse>
  <verse number="47">When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.</verse>
  <verse number="48">Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.</verse>
  <verse number="49">The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</verse>
  <verse number="50">Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.</verse>
  <verse number="51">And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told [him], saying, Thy son liveth.</verse>
  <verse number="52">Then inquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</verse>
  <verse number="53">So the father knew that [it was] at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.</verse>
  <verse number="54">This [is] again the second miracle [that] Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.</verse>
