<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But of the times and moments, brethren, you need not, that we should write to you;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For yourselves know perfectly, that the day of the Lord shall so come, as a thief in the night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For when they shall say, peace and security; then shall sudden destruction come upon them, as the pains upon her that is with child, and they shall not escape.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But you, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For all you are the children of light, and children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Therefore, let us not sleep, as others do; but let us watch, and be sober.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For they that sleep, sleep in the night; and they that are drunk, are drunk in the night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But let us, who are of the day, be sober, having on the breastplate of faith and charity, and for a helmet the hope of salvation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For God hath not appointed us unto wrath, but unto the purchasing of salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Who died for us; that, whether we watch or sleep, we may live together with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For which cause comfort one another; and edify one another, as you also do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And we beseech you, brethren, to know them who labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">That you esteem them more abundantly in charity, for their workâ€™s sake. Have peace with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And we beseech you, brethren, rebuke the unquiet, comfort the feeble minded, support the weak, be patient towards all men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">See that none render evil for evil to any man; but ever follow that which is good towards each other, and towards all men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Always rejoice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Pray without ceasing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">In all things give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Extinguish not the spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Despise not prophecies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">But prove all things; hold fast that which is good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">From all appearance of evil refrain yourselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And may the God of peace himself sanctify you in all things; that your whole spirit, and soul, and body, may be preserved blameless in the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He is faithful who hath called you, who also will do it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Brethren, pray for us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">I charge you by the Lord, that this epistle be read to all the holy brethren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.</p>
