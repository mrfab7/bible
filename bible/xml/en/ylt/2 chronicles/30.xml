  <verse number="1">And Hezekiah sendeth unto all Israel and Judah, and also letters he hath written unto Ephraim and Manasseh, to come in to the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem, to make a passover to Jehovah, God of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the king taketh counsel, and his heads, and all the assembly in Jerusalem, to make the passover in the second month,</verse>
  <verse number="3">for they have not been able to make it at that time, for the priests have not sanctified themselves sufficiently, and the people have not been gathered to Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the thing is right in the eyes of the king, and in the eyes of all the assembly,</verse>
  <verse number="5">and they establish the thing, to cause to pass over an intimation into all Israel, from Beer-Sheba even unto Dan, to come in to make a passover to Jehovah, God of Israel, in Jerusalem, for not for a long time had they done as it is written.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the runners go with letters from the hand of the king and his heads, into all Israel and Judah, even according to the command of the king, saying, ‘O sons of Israel, turn back unto Jehovah, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and He doth turn back unto the escaped part that is left of you from the hand of the kings of Asshur;</verse>
  <verse number="7">and do not be like your fathers, and like your brethren, who trespassed against Jehovah, God of their fathers, and He giveth them to desolation, as ye do see.</verse>
  <verse number="8">‘Now, harden not your neck like your fathers, give a hand to Jehovah, and come in to His sanctuary, that He hath sanctified to the age, and serve Jehovah your God, and the fierceness of His anger doth turn back from you;</verse>
  <verse number="9">for in your turning back unto Jehovah, your brethren and your sons have mercies before their captors, even to return to this land, for gracious and merciful is Jehovah your God, and He doth not turn aside the face from you, if ye turn back unto Him.’</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the runners are passing over from city to city, in the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, even unto Zebulun: and they are laughing at them, and mocking at them,</verse>
  <verse number="11">only, certain from Asher, and Manasseh, and from Zebulun, have been humbled, and come in to Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Also, in Judah hath the hand of God been to give to them one heart to do the command of the king and of the heads, in the matter of Jehovah;</verse>
  <verse number="13">and much people are gathered to Jerusalem, to make the feast of unleavened things in the second month—a mighty assembly for multitude.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And they arise and turn aside the altars that are in Jerusalem, and all the perfume altars they have turned aside, and cast them to the brook Kidron;</verse>
  <verse number="15">and they slaughter the passover-offering on the fourteenth of the second month, and the priests and the Levites have been ashamed, and sanctify themselves, and bring in burnt-offerings to the house of Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And they stand on their station according to their ordinance; according to the law of Moses the man of God the priests are sprinkling the blood out of the hand of the Levites,</verse>
  <verse number="17">for many are in the assembly who have not sanctified themselves, and the Levites are over the slaughtering of the passover-offerings for every one not clean, to sanctify him to Jehovah:</verse>
  <verse number="18">for a multitude of the people, many from Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, have not been cleansed, but have eaten the passover otherwise than it is written; but Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, ‘Jehovah, who is good, doth receive atonement for every one</verse>
  <verse number="19">who hath prepared his heart to seek God—Jehovah, God of his fathers—yet not according to the cleansing of the sanctuary;’</verse>
  <verse number="20">and Jehovah hearkeneth unto Hezekiah, and healeth the people.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And the sons of Israel, those found in Jerusalem, make the feast of unleavened things seven days with great joy; and giving praise to Jehovah day by day are the Levites and the priests, with instruments of praise before Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And Hezekiah speaketh unto the heart of all the Levites, those giving good understanding concerning Jehovah, and they eat the appointed thing seven days; sacrificing sacrifices of peace-offerings, and making confession to Jehovah, God of their fathers.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And all the assembly take counsel to keep other seven days, and they keep seven days with joy;</verse>
  <verse number="24">for Hezekiah king of Judah hath presented to the assembly a thousand bullocks, and seven thousand sheep; and the heads have presented to the assembly bullocks a thousand, and sheep ten thousand; and priests sanctify themselves in abundance.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And all the assembly of Judah rejoice, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the assembly, those coming in from Israel, and the sojourners, those coming in from the land of Israel, and those dwelling in Judah,</verse>
  <verse number="26">and there is great joy in Jerusalem; for from the days of Solomon son of David king of Israel there is not like this in Jerusalem,</verse>
  <verse number="27">and the priests, the Levites, rise and bless the people, and their voice is heard, and their prayer cometh in to His holy habitation, to the heavens.</verse>
