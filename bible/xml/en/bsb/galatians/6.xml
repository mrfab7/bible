<chapter book="Galatians" number="6" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Brothers, if someone is caught in a trespass, you who are spiritual should restore him with a spirit of gentleness. But watch yourself, or you also may be tempted.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Carry one another’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="3">If anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Each one should test his own work. Then he will have reason to boast in himself alone, and not in someone else.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For each one should carry his own load.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Nevertheless, the one who receives instruction in the word must share in all good things with his instructor.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Do not be deceived: God is not to be mocked. Whatever a man sows, he will reap in return.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The one who sows to please his flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; but the one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Let us not grow weary in well-doing, for in due time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone, and especially to the family of faith.</verse>
  <verse number="11">See what large letters I am using to write to you with my own hand!</verse>
  <verse number="12">Those who want to make a good impression outwardly are trying to compel you to be circumcised. They only do this to avoid persecution for the cross of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For the circumcised do not even keep the law themselves, yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast in your flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But as for me, may I never boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything. What counts is a new creation.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Peace and mercy to all who walk by this rule, even to the Israel of God.</verse>
  <verse number="17">From now on let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.</verse>
