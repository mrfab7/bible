  <verse number="1">And the word of Samuel will be to all Israel. And Israel will go forth to the meeting of Philisteim for war, and they will encamp upon the Stone of Help: and Philisteim encamped in Aphek.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Philisteim will set in array to meet Israel: and the battle will smite, and Israel will be smitten before Philisteim: and they will strike the array in the field, about four thousand men.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the people will come to the camp, and the old men of Israel will, say, Wherefore did Jehovah smite us this day before Philisteim? We will take to us from Shiloh the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and it shall come into the midst of us and save us from the hand of our enemies.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the people will send to Shiloh, and they will lift up from thence the ark of the covenant of Jehovah of armies, sitting upon the Cherubims: and there the two sons of Eli with the ark of the covenant of God, Hophni and Phinehas.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And it will be when the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came to the camp, and all Israel will shout with great shouts, and the earth will be put in motion.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Philisteim will hear the voice of the shout, and they will say, What the voice of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? and they knew that the ark of Jehovah came into the camp.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the Philisteim will be afraid, for they said, God came into the camp. And they will say, Wo to us! for at was not as this yesterday, the third day.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Wo to us! who shall deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? these those gods smiting Egypt with every blow in the desert.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Be strong, and be for men, Philisteim, lest ye shall serve to the Hebrews as they served to you: and be for men and fight.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Philisteim will fight and smite Israel, and they will flee, a man to his tent: and the blow will be very great, and there will fall from Israel thirty thousand footmen.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the ark of God was taken, and the two sons of Eli were slain, Hophni and Phinehas.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And a man of Benjamin will run from the array, and he will come to Shiloh in that day; and his garments rent and earth upon his head.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And he will come, and behold, Eli sitting upon a seat of the side of the way, looking about: for his heart was trembling for the ark of God. And the man came to announce in the city, and all the city will cry out.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Eli will hear the voice of the cry, and will say, What the voice of this noise? And the man hastened, and he will go in and announce to Eli.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Eli the son of ninety and eight years; and his eyes standing, and he will not be able to see.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And the man will say to Eli, I came from the array, and I fled from the array this day; And he will say, What was the word, my son?</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he bearing tidings will answer and say, Israel fled before Philisteim, and also a great slaughter was among the people, and also thy two sons died, Hophni and Phinehas; and the ark of God was taken.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And it will be when he made mention of the ark of God, and he will fall from off the seat backwards by the side of the gate, and his neck will break, and he will die: for he was an old Man and heavy. And he judged Israel forty years.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, conceived to bring forth: and she will hear the message of the taking of the ark of God, and the death of her father-in-law and her husband, and she will bow and bring forth, for her pains turned upon her.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And about the time of her death, and they standing by will speak to her, Thou shalt not be afraid, for thou broughtest forth a son. And she answered not, and set not her heart.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And she will call the boy, Where the Glory? saying, The glory uncovered from Israel: (for the taking of the ark of God, and for her father-in-law, and her husband.)</verse>
  <verse number="22">And she will say, The glory uncovered from Israel, for the ark of God was taken.</verse>
