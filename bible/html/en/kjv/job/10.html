<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">[Is it] good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">[Are] thy days as the days of man? [are] thy years as manâ€™s days,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">That thou inquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and [there is] none that can deliver out of thine hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And these [things] hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this [is] with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">If I be wicked, woe unto me; and [if] I be righteous, [yet] will I not lift up my head. [I am] full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war [are] against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">[Are] not my days few? cease [then, and] let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Before I go [whence] I shall not return, [even] to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">A land of darkness, as darkness [itself; and] of the shadow of death, without any order, and [where] the light [is] as darkness.</p>
