1	And these three men will cease from answering Job, for he is just in his eyes.
2	And the anger of Elihu will kindle, son of Barachel the Buzite, from the family of Ram: against Job was, his anger kindled, for his justifying his soul above God.
3	And against his three friends was his anger kindled, because they, found not an answer, and they will condemn Job.
4	And Elihu waited for Job in words, for they were old for days above him.
5	And Elihu will see that not an Answer in the mouth of the three men, and his anger will kindle,
6	And Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite will answer and say, I few for days, and ye old men; for this I was afraid, and I shall fear showing you my knowledge.
7	I said, days shall speak, and multitude of years shall make known wisdom.
8	But it is a spirit in man, and the breath of the Almighty will cause them to understand.
9	Not the many will be wise: and old men understand judgment.
10	For this, I said, Hear to me; I also will show my knowledge.
11	Behold, I waited for your words, giving ear even to your understandings while ye will search out words.
12	And I will show myself attentive even to you, and behold, none from you confuting to Job, answering his words.
13	Lest ye shall say, We found wisdom: God will thrust him, not man.
14	And he arranged not words against me: and I will not turn back to him with your words.
15	They were confounded; they answered no more: they removed words from themselves.
16	And I waited, (for they will not speak, for they stood, they answered no more:)
17	I also will answer my part, I also will show my knowledge.
18	For I was filled with words, the spirit of my belly pressed upon me.
19	Behold, my belly as wine it will not open; it will break open as new wine skins.
20	I will speak, and it will breathe to me: I will open my lips and answer.
21	Not now shall I lift up the face of man, and I shall not flatter to man.
22	For I knew not, shall I flatter; for a little while, he making me will take me away.
