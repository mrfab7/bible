  <verse number="1">Then Job answered and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?</verse>
  <verse number="4">I am as one that is a laughing-stock to his neighbour, a man that called upon God, and he answered him: the just, the perfect man is a laughing-stock.</verse>
  <verse number="5">In the thought of him that is at ease there is contempt for misfortune; it is ready for them whose foot slippeth.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The tents of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:</verse>
  <verse number="8">Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee; and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Who knoweth not in all these, that the hand of LORD hath wrought this?</verse>
  <verse number="10">In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Doth not the ear try words, even as the palate tasteth its meat?</verse>
  <verse number="12">With aged men is wisdom, and in length of days understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="13">With him is wisdom and might; he hath counsel and understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again; he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up; again, he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="16">With him is strength and effectual working; the deceived and the deceiver are his.</verse>
  <verse number="17">He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and judges maketh he fools.</verse>
  <verse number="18">He looseth the bond of kings, and bindeth their loins with a girdle.</verse>
  <verse number="19">He leadeth priests away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.</verse>
  <verse number="20">He removeth the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the elders.</verse>
  <verse number="21">He poureth contempt upon princes, and looseth the belt of the strong.</verse>
  <verse number="22">He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death.</verse>
  <verse number="23">He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he spreadeth the nations abroad, and bringeth them in.</verse>
  <verse number="24">He taketh away the heart of the chiefs of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.</verse>
  <verse number="25">They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.</verse>
