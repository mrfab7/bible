<chapter book="Job" number="10" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint on myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.</verse>
  <verse number="2">I will say to God, Do not condemn me; show me why you contend with me.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Is it good to you that you should oppress, that you should despise the work of your hands, and shine on the counsel of the wicked?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Have you eyes of flesh? or see you as man sees?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Are your days as the days of man? are your years as man’s days,</verse>
  <verse number="6">That you enquire after my iniquity, and search after my sin?</verse>
  <verse number="7">You know that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of your hand.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Your hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet you do destroy me.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Remember, I beseech you, that you have made me as the clay; and will you bring me into dust again?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Have you not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?</verse>
  <verse number="11">You have clothed me with skin and flesh, and have fenced me with bones and sinews.</verse>
  <verse number="12">You have granted me life and favor, and your visitation has preserved my spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And these things have you hid in your heart: I know that this is with you.</verse>
  <verse number="14">If I sin, then you mark me, and you will not acquit me from my iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="15">If I be wicked, woe to me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see you my affliction;</verse>
  <verse number="16">For it increases. You hunt me as a fierce lion: and again you show yourself marvelous on me.</verse>
  <verse number="17">You renew your witnesses against me, and increase your indignation on me; changes and war are against me.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Why then have you brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!</verse>
  <verse number="19">I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,</verse>
  <verse number="21">Before I go from where I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;</verse>
  <verse number="22">A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.</verse>
