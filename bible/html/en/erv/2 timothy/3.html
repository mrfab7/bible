<div class="chapter" data-book="2 Timothy" data-chapter="3" data-translation="English Revised Version" data-translation-id="erv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But know this, that in the last days grievous times shall come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, railers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">traitors, headstrong, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">holding a form of godliness, but having denied the power thereof: from these also turn away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For of these are they that creep into houses, and take captive silly women laden with sins, led away by divers lusts,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And like as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also withstand the truth; men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be evident unto all men, as theirs also came to be.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But thou didst follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">persecutions, sufferings; what things befell me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: and out of them all the Lord delivered me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Yea, and all that would live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But evil men and impostors shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But abide thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">and that from a babe thou hast known the sacred writings which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Every scripture inspired of God is also profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">that the man of God may be complete, furnished completely unto every good work.</p>
