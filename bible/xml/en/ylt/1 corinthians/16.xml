<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="16" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And concerning the collection that is for the saints, as I directed to the assemblies of Galatia, so also ye—do ye;</verse>
  <verse number="2">on every first day of the week, let each one of you lay by him, treasuring up whatever he may have prospered, that when I may come then collections may not be made;</verse>
  <verse number="3">and whenever I may come, whomsoever ye may approve, through letters, these I will send to carry your favour to Jerusalem;</verse>
  <verse number="4">and if it be meet for me also to go, with me they shall go.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And I will come unto you, when I pass through Macedonia—for Macedonia I do pass through—</verse>
  <verse number="6">and with you, it may be, I will abide, or even winter, that ye may send me forward whithersoever I go,</verse>
  <verse number="7">for I do not wish to see you now in the passing, but I hope to remain a certain time with you, if the Lord may permit;</verse>
  <verse number="8">and I will remain in Ephesus till the Pentecost,</verse>
  <verse number="9">for a door to me hath been opened—great and effectual—and withstanders are many.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And if Timotheus may come, see that he may become without fear with you, for the work of the Lord he doth work, even as I,</verse>
  <verse number="11">no one, then, may despise him; and send ye him forward in peace, that he may come to me, for I expect him with the brethren;</verse>
  <verse number="12">and concerning Apollos our brother, much I did entreat him that he may come unto you with the brethren, and it was not at all his will that he may come now, and he will come when he may find convenient.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Watch ye, stand in the faith; be men, be strong;</verse>
  <verse number="14">let all your things be done in love.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And I entreat you, brethren, ye have known the household of Stephanas, that it is the first-fruit of Achaia, and to the ministration to the saints they did set themselves—</verse>
  <verse number="16">that ye also be subject to such, and to every one who is working with us and labouring;</verse>
  <verse number="17">and I rejoice over the presence of Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus, because the lack of you did these fill up;</verse>
  <verse number="18">for they did refresh my spirit and yours; acknowledge ye, therefore, those who are such.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Salute you do the assemblies of Asia; salute you much in the Lord do Aquilas and Priscilla, with the assembly in their house;</verse>
  <verse number="20">salute you do all the brethren; salute ye one another in an holy kiss.</verse>
  <verse number="21">The salutation of me Paul with my hand;</verse>
  <verse number="22">if any one doth not love the Lord Jesus Christ—let him be anathema! The Lord hath come!</verse>
  <verse number="23">The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ is with you;</verse>
  <verse number="24">my love is with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.</verse>
