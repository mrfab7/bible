  <verse number="1">But it came to pass in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus, that a census should be made of all the habitable world.</verse>
  <verse number="2">The census itself first took place when Cyrenius had the government of Syria.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And all went to be inscribed in the census roll, each to his own city:</verse>
  <verse number="4">and Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city Nazareth to Judaea, to David’s city, the which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David,</verse>
  <verse number="5">to be inscribed in the census roll with Mary who was betrothed to him [as his] wife, she being great with child.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And it came to pass, while they were there, the days of her giving birth [to her child] were fulfilled,</verse>
  <verse number="7">and she brought forth her first-born son, and wrapped him up in swaddling-clothes and laid him in the manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And there were shepherds in that country abiding without, and keeping watch by night over their flock.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And lo, an angel of [the] Lord was there by them, and [the] glory of [the] Lord shone around them, and they feared [with] great fear.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the angel said to them, Fear not, for behold, I announce to you glad tidings of great joy, which shall be to all the people;</verse>
  <verse number="11">for to-day a Saviour has been born to you in David’s city, who is Christ [the] Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And this is the sign to you: ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling-clothes, and lying in a manger.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying,</verse>
  <verse number="14">Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good pleasure in men.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And it came to pass, as the angels departed from them into heaven, that the shepherds said to one another, Let us make our way then now as far as Bethlehem, and let us see this thing that is come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And they came with haste, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger;</verse>
  <verse number="17">and having seen [it] they made known about the country the thing which had been said to them concerning this child.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And all who heard [it] wondered at the things said to them by the shepherds.</verse>
  <verse number="19">But Mary kept all these things [in her mind], pondering [them] in her heart.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all things which they had heard and seen, as it had been said to them.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And when eight days were fulfilled for circumcising him, his name was called Jesus, which was the name given by the angel before he had been conceived in the womb.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And when the days were fulfilled for their purifying according to the law of Moses, they brought him to Jerusalem to present [him] to the Lord</verse>
  <verse number="23">(as it is written in the law of [the] Lord: Every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord),</verse>
  <verse number="24">and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of [the] Lord: A pair of turtle doves, or two young pigeons.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; and this man was just and pious, awaiting the consolation of Israel, and [the] Holy Spirit was upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And it was divinely communicated to him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death before he should see [the] Lord’s Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And he came in the Spirit into the temple; and as the parents brought in the child Jesus that they might do for him according to the custom of the law,</verse>
  <verse number="28">he received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,</verse>
  <verse number="29">Lord, now thou lettest thy bondman go, according to thy word, in peace;</verse>
  <verse number="30">for mine eyes have seen thy salvation,</verse>
  <verse number="31">which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples;</verse>
  <verse number="32">a light for revelation of [the] Gentiles and [the] glory of thy people Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And his father and mother wondered at the things which were said concerning him.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, Lo, this [child] is set for the fall and rising up of many in Israel, and for a sign spoken against;</verse>
  <verse number="35">(and even a sword shall go through thine own soul;) so that [the] thoughts may be revealed from many hearts.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And there was a prophetess, Anna, daughter of Phanuel, of [the] tribe of Asher, who was far advanced in years, having lived with [her] husband seven years from her virginity,</verse>
  <verse number="37">and herself a widow up to eighty-four years; who did not depart from the temple, serving night and day with fastings and prayers;</verse>
  <verse number="38">and she coming up the same hour gave praise to the Lord, and spoke of him to all those who waited for redemption in Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And when they had completed all things according to the law of [the] Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own city Nazareth.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And the child grew and waxed strong [in spirit], filled with wisdom, and God’s grace was upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And his parents went yearly to Jerusalem at the feast of the passover.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And when he was twelve years old, and they went up [to Jerusalem] according to the custom of the feast</verse>
  <verse number="43">and had completed the days, as they returned, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, and his parents knew not [of it];</verse>
  <verse number="44">but, supposing him to be in the company that journeyed together, they went a day’s journey, and sought him among their relations and acquaintances:</verse>
  <verse number="45">and not having found him they returned to Jerusalem seeking him.</verse>
  <verse number="46">And it came to pass, after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers and hearing them and asking them questions.</verse>
  <verse number="47">And all who heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.</verse>
  <verse number="48">And when they saw him they were amazed: and his mother said to him, Child, why hast thou dealt thus with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee distressed.</verse>
  <verse number="49">And he said to them, Why [is it] that ye have sought me? did ye not know that I ought to be [occupied] in my Father’s business?</verse>
  <verse number="50">And they understood not the thing that he said to them.</verse>
  <verse number="51">And he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and he was in subjection to them. And his mother kept all these things in her heart.</verse>
  <verse number="52">And Jesus advanced in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and men.</verse>
