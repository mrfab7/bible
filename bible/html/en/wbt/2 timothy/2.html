<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And the things that thou hast heard from me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And if a man also striveth for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he striveth lawfully.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The husbandman that laboreth must be first partaker of the fruits.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">In which I suffer trouble, as an evil-doer, even to bonds; but the word of God is not bound.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">It is a faithful saying: For if we are dead with him, we shall also live with him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they contend not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Study to show thyself approved to God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase to more ungodliness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymeneus and Philetus;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth firm, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor, and some to dishonor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">If a man therefore will cleanse himself from these, he will be a vessel to honor, sanctified and meet for the masterâ€™s use, and prepared to every good work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they gender contentions.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And the servant of the Lord must not contend; but be gentle to all men, apt to teach, patient,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God perhaps will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.</p>
