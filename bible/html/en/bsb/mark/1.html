<p class="verse" data-verse="1">This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">As it is written in Isaiah the prophet: “Behold, I will send My messenger ahead of You, who will prepare Your way.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">“A voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for Him.’”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">People went out to him from all of Jerusalem and the countryside of Judea. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">John was clothed in camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And he proclaimed: “After me will come One more powerful than I, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">I baptize you with water, but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">As soon as Jesus came up out of the water, He saw the heavens breaking open and the Spirit descending on Him like a dove.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And a voice came from heaven: “You are My beloved Son; in You I am well pleased.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">At once the Spirit drove Jesus into the wilderness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">and He was there for forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and the angels ministered to Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">After the arrest of John, Jesus went into Galilee and proclaimed the gospel of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">“The time is fulfilled,” He said, “and the kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe in the gospel!”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">“Come, follow Me,” Jesus said, “and I will make you fishers of men.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And at once they left their nets and followed Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Going on a little farther, He saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat, mending their nets.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Immediately Jesus called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Then Jesus and His companions went to Capernaum, and right away Jesus entered the synagogue on the Sabbath and began to teach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The people were astonished at His teaching, because He taught as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Suddenly a man with an unclean spirit cried out in the synagogue:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">“What do You want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are—the Holy One of God!”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">But Jesus rebuked the spirit. “Be silent!” He said. “Come out of him!”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">At this, the unclean spirit threw the man into convulsions and came out with a loud shriek.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">All the people were amazed and began to ask one another, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him!”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And the news about Jesus spread quickly through the whole region of Galilee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">As soon as Jesus and His companions had left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Simon’s mother-in-law was sick in bed with a fever, and they promptly told Jesus about her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">So He went to her, took her by the hand, and helped her up. The fever left her, and she began to serve them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">That evening, after sunset, people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">and the whole town gathered at the door.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And He healed many who were ill with various diseases and drove out many demons. But He would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who He was.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up and went out to a solitary place to pray.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Simon and his companions went to look for Him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">and when they found Him, they said, “Everyone is looking for You!”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">But Jesus answered, “Let us go on to the neighboring towns so I can preach there as well, for that is why I have come.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">So He went throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">Then a leper came to Jesus, begging on his knees: “If You are willing, You can make me clean.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Moved with compassion, Jesus reached out His hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” He said. “Be clean!”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">And immediately the leprosy left him, and the man was cleansed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">Jesus promptly sent him away with a stern warning:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">“See that you don’t tell anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and present the offering Moses prescribed for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">But the man went out and openly began to proclaim and spread the news. Consequently, Jesus could no longer enter a town in plain view, but He stayed out in solitary places. Yet people came to Him from every quarter.</p>
