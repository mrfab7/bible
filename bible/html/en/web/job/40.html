<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Moreover Yahweh answered Job,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“Shall he who argues contend with the Almighty? He who argues with God, let him answer it.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Then Job answered Yahweh,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">“Behold, I am of small account. What shall I answer you? I lay my hand on my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I have spoken once, and I will not answer; Yes, twice, but I will proceed no further.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Then Yahweh answered Job out of the whirlwind,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">“Now brace yourself like a man. I will question you, and you will answer me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Will you even annul my judgment? Will you condemn me, that you may be justified?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Or do you have an arm like God? Can you thunder with a voice like him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">“Now deck yourself with excellency and dignity. Array yourself with honor and majesty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Pour out the fury of your anger. Look at everyone who is proud, and bring him low.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Look at everyone who is proud, and humble him. Crush the wicked in their place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Hide them in the dust together. Bind their faces in the hidden place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Then I will also admit to you that your own right hand can save you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">“See now, behemoth, which I made as well as you. He eats grass as an ox.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Look now, his strength is in his thighs. His force is in the muscles of his belly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He moves his tail like a cedar. The sinews of his thighs are knit together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">His bones are like tubes of brass. His limbs are like bars of iron.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He is the chief of the ways of God. He who made him gives him his sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Surely the mountains produce food for him, where all the animals of the field play.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He lies under the lotus trees, in the covert of the reed, and the marsh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The lotuses cover him with their shade. The willows of the brook surround him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Behold, if a river overflows, he doesn’t tremble. He is confident, though the Jordan swells even to his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Shall any take him when he is on the watch, or pierce through his nose with a snare?</p>
