<p class="verse" data-verse="1">On the day Moses finished setting up the tabernacle, he anointed and consecrated it and all its furnishings, along with the altar and all its utensils.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And the leaders of Israel, the heads of their families, presented an offering. These men were the tribal leaders who had supervised the registration.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">They brought as their offering before the LORD six covered carts and twelve oxen—an ox from each leader and a cart from every two leaders—and presented them before the tabernacle.</p>
