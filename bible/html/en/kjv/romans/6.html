<p class="verse" data-verse="1">What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also [in the likeness] of [his] resurrection:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with [him], that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For he that is dead is freed from sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Neither yield ye your members [as] instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members [as] instruments of righteousness unto God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things [is] death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For the wages of sin [is] death; but the gift of God [is] eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
