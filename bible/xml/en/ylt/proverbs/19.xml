  <verse number="6">Many entreat the face of the noble, And all have made friendship to a man of gifts.</verse>
  <verse number="7">All the brethren of the poor have hated him, Surely also his friends have been far from him, He is pursuing words—they are not!</verse>

  <verse number="11">The wisdom of a man hath deferred his anger, And his glory is to pass over transgression.</verse>
  <verse number="12">The wrath of a king is a growl as of a young lion, And as dew on the herb his good-will.</verse>

  <verse number="26">Whoso is spoiling a father causeth a mother to flee, A son causing shame, and bringing confusion.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Cease, my son, to hear instruction—To err from sayings of knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="28">A worthless witness scorneth judgment, And the mouth of the wicked swalloweth iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Judgments have been prepared for scorners, And stripes for the back of fools!</verse>
