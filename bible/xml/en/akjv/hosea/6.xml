  <verse number="1">Come, and let us return to the LORD: for he has torn, and he will heal us; he has smitten, and he will bind us up.</verse>

  <verse number="3">Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come to us as the rain, as the latter and former rain to the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="4">O Ephraim, what shall I do to you? O Judah, what shall I do to you? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goes away.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and your judgments are as the light that goes forth.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted with blood.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness.</verse>
  <verse number="10">I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is the prostitution of Ephraim, Israel is defiled.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Also, O Judah, he has set an harvest for you, when I returned the captivity of my people.</verse>
