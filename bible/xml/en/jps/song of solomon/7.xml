<chapter book="Song of Solomon" number="7" translation="JPS Tanakh 1917 OT" translationID="jps" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">How beautiful are thy steps in sandals, O prince’s daughter! The roundings of thy thighs are like the links of a chain, The work of the hands of a skilled workman.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Thy navel is like a round goblet, Wherein no mingled wine is wanting; Thy belly is like a heap of wheat Set about with lilies.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Thy two breasts are like two fawns That are twins of a gazelle.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; Thine eyes as the pools in Heshbon, By the gate of Bath-rabbim; Thy nose is like the tower of Lebanon Which looketh toward Damascus.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Thy head upon thee is like Carmel, And the hair of thy head like purple; The king is held captive in the tresses thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="6">How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!</verse>
  <verse number="7">This thy stature is like to a palm-tree, And thy breasts to clusters of grapes.</verse>
  <verse number="8">I said: ‘I will climb up into the palm-tree, I will take hold of the branches thereof; And let thy breasts be as clusters of the vine, And the smell of thy countenance like apples;</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine, That glideth down smoothly for my beloved, Moving gently the lips of those that are asleep.’</verse>
  <verse number="10">I am my beloved’s, And his desire is toward me.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; Let us lodge in the villages.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Let us get up early to the vineyards; Let us see whether the vine hath budded, Whether the vine-blossom be opened, And the pomegranates be in flower; There will I give thee my love.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The mandrakes give forth fragrance, And at our doors are all manner of precious fruits, New and old, Which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.</verse>
