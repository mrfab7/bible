<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="12" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And concerning spiritual things, brethren, I wish you not to be ignorant.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Ye know that ye were the nations, to dumb idols, as ye were led, being carried away.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Wherefore I make known to you, that none speaking in the Spirit of God calls Jesus anathema: and none can say Lord Jesus, but in the Holy Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And there are distinctions of favors, and the same Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And there are distinctions of services, and the same Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And there are distinctions of performances, and it is the same God performing all things in all.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And to each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for profit.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For truly to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;</verse>
  <verse number="9">And to another faith in the same Spirit; and to another graces of healings in the same Spirit;</verse>
  <verse number="10">And to another performances of powers; and to another discriminations of spirits; and to another kinds of tongues; and to another interpretation of tongues:</verse>
  <verse number="11">And all these works one and the same Spirit, dividing to each his own things as be will.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the one body, being many, is one body: so also is Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For also in one Spirit were we all immersed into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether servants or free; and we have all been given to drink into one Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For also the body is not one member, but many.</verse>
  <verse number="15">If the foot say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; by this is it not of the body.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And if the ear say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; by this is it not of the body.</verse>
  <verse number="17">If the whole body an eye, where the hearing If the whole hearing, where the smelling?</verse>
  <verse number="18">And now has God set the members each one of them in the body, as he would.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And if all were one member, where the body.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And now truly many members, and one body.</verse>
  <verse number="21">The eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But much rather the members of the body, seeming to be weak, are necessary:</verse>
  <verse number="23">And what we think to be less honourable of the body, upon these we put more abundant honour; and our unseemly parts have more abundant decorum.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And our becoming parts have no need: but God blended the body together, to the wanting having given more abundant honour:</verse>
  <verse number="25">That no division be in the body; but the members should care the same for one another.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer together; or one member is honoured, all the members rejoice together.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And ye are the body of Christ, and members by parts.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And whom truly God set in the church, first the sent, second the prophets, third teachers, then powers, then graces of healings, helps, directions, kinds of tongues.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Not all sent: not all prophets: not all teachers: not all powers:</verse>
  <verse number="30">All have not the favors of healing: not all speaking with tongues: not all interpret accurately.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And be emulous of the better favors: and yet I shew you a way according to eminence.</verse>
