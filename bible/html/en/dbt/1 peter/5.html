<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The elders which [are] among you I exhort, who [am their] fellow-elder and witness of the sufferings of the Christ, who also [am] partaker of the glory about to be revealed:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">shepherd the flock of God which [is] among you, exercising oversight, not by necessity, but willingly; not for base gain, but readily;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">not as lording it over your possessions, but being models for the flock.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And when the chief shepherd is manifested ye shall receive the unfading crown of glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Likewise [ye] younger, be subject to [the] elder, and all of you bind on humility towards one another; for God sets himself against [the] proud, but to [the] humble gives grace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in [the due] time;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">having cast all your care upon him, for he cares about you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Be vigilant, watch. Your adversary [the] devil as a roaring lion walks about seeking whom he may devour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Whom resist, stedfast in faith, knowing that the selfsame sufferings are accomplished in your brotherhood which [is] in [the] world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But the God of all grace who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ Jesus, when ye have suffered for a little while, himself shall make perfect, stablish, strengthen, ground:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">to him [be] the glory and the might for the ages of the ages. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">By Silvanus, the faithful brother, as I suppose, I have written to you briefly; exhorting and testifying that this is [the] true grace of God in which ye stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">She that is elected with [you] in Babylon salutes you, and Marcus my son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Salute one another with a kiss of love. Peace be with you all who [are] in Christ.</p>
