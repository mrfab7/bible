<div class="chapter" data-book="Habakkuk" data-chapter="3" data-translation="American Standard Version" data-translation-id="asv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, set to Shigionoth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">O Jehovah, I have heard the report of thee, and am afraid: O Jehovah, revive thy work in the midst of the years; In the midst of the years make it known; In wrath remember mercy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">God came from Teman, And the Holy One from mount Paran. [Selah. His glory covered the heavens, And the earth was full of his praise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And his brightness was as the light; He had rays coming forth from his hand; And there was the hiding of his power.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Before him went the pestilence, And fiery bolts went forth at his feet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He stood, and measured the earth; He beheld, and drove asunder the nations; And the eternal mountains were scattered; The everlasting hills did bow; His goings were as of old.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction; The curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Was Jehovah displeased with the rivers? Was thine anger against the rivers, Or thy wrath against the sea, That thou didst ride upon thy horses, Upon thy chariots of salvation?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Thy bow was made quite bare; The oaths to the tribes were a sure word. [Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The mountains saw thee, and were afraid; The tempest of waters passed by; The deep uttered its voice, And lifted up its hands on high.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The sun and moon stood still in their habitation, At the light of thine arrows as they went, At the shining of thy glittering spear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Thou didst march through the land in indignation; Thou didst thresh the nations in anger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, For the salvation of thine anointed; Thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked man, Laying bare the foundation even unto the neck. [Selah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Thou didst pierce with his own staves the head of his warriors: They came as a whirlwind to scatter me; Their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Thou didst tread the sea with thy horses, The heap of mighty waters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">I heard, and my body trembled, My lips quivered at the voice; Rottenness entereth into my bones, and I tremble in my place; Because I must wait quietly for the day of trouble, For the coming up of the people that invadeth us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For though the fig-tree shall not flourish, Neither shall fruit be in the vines; The labor of the olive shall fail, And the fields shall yield no food; The flock shall be cut off from the fold, And there shall be no herd in the stalls:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Yet I will rejoice in Jehovah, I will joy in the God of my salvation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Jehovah, the Lord, is my strength; And he maketh my feet like hindsâ€™ feet, And will make me to walk upon my high places.</p>
