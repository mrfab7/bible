<div class="chapter" data-book="2 Corinthians" data-chapter="1" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Who comforts us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also abounds by Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And our hope of you is steadfast, knowing, that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so shall you be also of the consolation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For we would not, brothers, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, so that we despaired even of life:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raises the dead:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">You also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed on us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For we write none other things to you, than what you read or acknowledge; and I trust you shall acknowledge even to the end;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">As also you have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as you also are ourâ€™s in the day of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And in this confidence I was minded to come to you before, that you might have a second benefit;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia to you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yes yes, and no no?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But as God is true, our word toward you was not yes and no.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yes and no, but in him was yes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For all the promises of God in him are yes, and in him Amen, to the glory of God by us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Now he which establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, is God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Who has also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Moreover I call God for a record on my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet to Corinth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith you stand.</p>
