<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But Baldad the Suhite responded by saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">How long will you throw around words? Understand first, and then let us speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Why have we been treated like mules, as if we were unworthy before you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">You, who ruins your own soul in your fury, will the earth be forsaken because of you, and will the cliffs be moved from their place?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Will not the light of the impious be put out, and the flame of his fire refuse to shine?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Light will become darkness in his tabernacle, and the lamp that is over him will be extinguished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">His strong steps will be constrained, and his own counsel will cast him down uncontrollably.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For he has caused his own feet to go into a net, and he has walked into its web.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">His heel will be held in a snare, and thirst will rage against him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">A trap has been hidden for him in the earth, and a decoy, along his path.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Horrifying things will terrify him everywhere and will entangle his feet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Let his strength be diminished by famine, and let starvation invade his ribs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Let it devour the beauty of his skin; let the ancient death consume his arms.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Let his confidence be torn away from his tabernacle, and let ruin trample over him like a king.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Let the companions of he who is not, dwell in his tabernacle; let brimstone rain down upon his tabernacle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Let his roots be dried up from beneath him, and his harvest be crushed from above.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Let the memory of him perish from the earth, and let not his name be celebrated in the streets.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He will expel him from light into darkness, and he will remove him from the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Neither his offspring, nor his descendents, will exist among his people, nor will there be any remnants in his country.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The last will be astonished at his day, and the first will be overcome with horror.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And so, these are the tabernacles of the sinful, and this the place of he who does not know God.</p>
