  <verse number="1">And the sabbath having past, Mary the Magdalene, and Mary of James, and Salome, bought spices, that having come, they may anoint him,</verse>
  <verse number="2">and early in the morning of the first of the sabbaths, they come unto the sepulchre, at the rising of the sun,</verse>
  <verse number="3">and they said among themselves, ‘Who shall roll away for us the stone out of the door of the sepulchre?’</verse>
  <verse number="4">And having looked, they see that the stone hath been rolled away—for it was very great,</verse>
  <verse number="5">and having entered into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right hand, arrayed in a long white robe, and they were amazed.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And he saith to them, ‘Be not amazed, ye seek Jesus the Nazarene, the crucified: he did rise—he is not here; lo, the place where they laid him!</verse>
  <verse number="7">and go, say to his disciples, and Peter, that he doth go before you to Galilee; there ye shall see him, as he said to you.’</verse>
  <verse number="8">And, having come forth quickly, they fled from the sepulchre, and trembling and amazement had seized them, and to no one said they anything, for they were afraid.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And he, having risen in the morning of the first of the sabbaths, did appear first to Mary the Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven demons;</verse>
  <verse number="10">she having gone, told those who had been with him, mourning and weeping;</verse>
  <verse number="11">and they, having heard that he is alive, and was seen by her, did not believe.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And after these things, to two of them, as they are going into a field, walking, he was manifested in another form,</verse>
  <verse number="13">and they having gone, told to the rest; not even them did they believe.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Afterwards, as they are reclining (at meat), he was manifested to the eleven, and did reproach their unbelief and stiffness of heart, because they believed not those having seen him being raised;</verse>
  <verse number="15">and he said to them, ‘Having gone to all the world, proclaim the good news to all the creation;</verse>
  <verse number="16">he who hath believed, and hath been baptized, shall be saved; and he who hath not believed, shall be condemned.</verse>
  <verse number="17">‘And signs shall accompany those believing these things; in my name demons they shall cast out; with new tongues they shall speak;</verse>
  <verse number="18">serpents they shall take up; and if any deadly thing they may drink, it shall not hurt them; on the ailing they shall lay hands, and they shall be well.’</verse>
  <verse number="19">The Lord, then, indeed, after speaking to them, was received up to the heaven, and sat on the right hand of God;</verse>
  <verse number="20">and they, having gone forth, did preach everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word, through the signs following. Amen.</verse>
