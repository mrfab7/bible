<chapter book="2 John" number="1" translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" translationID="cpdv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">The Elder to the Elect Lady, and those born of her, whom I love in the truth: and not I alone, but also all those who have known the truth,</verse>
  <verse number="2">because the truth which dwells in us shall be with us for eternity.</verse>
  <verse number="3">May grace, mercy, and peace be with you from God the Father, and from Christ Jesus, the Son of the Father, in truth and in love.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I was very glad because I discovered some of your sons walking in the truth, just as we received the commandment from the Father.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And now I petition you, Lady, not as if writing a new commandment to you, but instead that commandment which we have had from the beginning: that we love one another.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And this is love: that we walk according to his commandments. For this is the commandment that you have heard in the same way from the beginning, and in which you should walk.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess that Jesus Christ has arrived in the flesh. Such a one as this is a deceiver and an antichrist.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Be cautious for yourselves, lest you lose what you have accomplished, and so that, instead, you may receive a full reward.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Everyone who withdraws and does not remain in the doctrine of Christ, does not have God. Whoever remains in the doctrine, such a one as this has both the Father and the Son.</verse>
  <verse number="10">If anyone comes to you, and does not bring this doctrine, do not be willing to receive him into the house, and do not speak a greeting to him.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For whoever speaks a greeting to him, is speaking with his evil works.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I have much more to write to you, but I am not willing to do so through paper and ink. For I hope that I may be with you in the future, and that I may speak face to face, so that your joy may be full.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The sons of your Elect Sister greet you.</verse>
