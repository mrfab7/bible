  <verse number="1">In the twelfth year to Ahaz king of Judah, reigned Hoshea son of Elah, in Shomeron over Israel nine years.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah, but not as the kings of Israel which were before him.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Amur; and Hoshea will be to him a servant, and he will turn back to him a gift.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the king of Assur will find conspiracy in Hoshea, because he sent messengers to So, king of Egypt, and he brought up no gift to the king of Assur, as year by year; and the king of Assur will surround him and bind him in the house of shutting up.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the king of Assur will come up upon all the land, and he will comp up to Shomeron, and press upon her three years.</verse>
  <verse number="6">In the ninth year to Hoshea the king of Assur took Shomeron, and he will carry Israel into exile to Assur, and set them in Halah and in Habor, the river of Gozan, and the cities of the Medes.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And it will be that the sons of Israel sinned against Jehovah their God, having brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and they will fear other gods.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And they will go in the laws of the nations which Jehovah dispossessed from the face of the sons of Israel, and the kings of Israel which they made.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the sons of Israel will cover the words not thus concerning Jehovah their God, and they will build to them heights in all their cities from the tower of those watching even to the fortified city.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And they will set to them statues and images upon every high hill, and under every green tree.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And they will burn incense there in all the heights as the nations which Jehovah carried into exile from their face; and they will do evil words to irritate Jehovah:</verse>
  <verse number="12">And they will serve blocks which Jehovah said to them, Ye shall not do this word.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And Jehovah will testify in Israel and in Judah by the hand of all his prophets, all seeing, saying, Turn back from your evil ways and watch my commands, my laws according to all my instruction which I commanded your fathers, and which I Sent to you by the hand of my servants the prophets.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And they heard not, and they will harden their neck as the neck of their fathers who did not believe in Jehovah their God.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And they will reject his laws and his covenant which he cut out with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified in them; and they will go after vanity, and they will be vain, and after the nations which were round about them which Jehovah commanded them not to do as they.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And they will forsake all the commands of Jehovah their God, and make to them a molten thing, two Calves; and they will make images, and they will worship to all the army of the heavens, and serve Baal.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And they will cause their sons and their daughters to pass through in fire, and divine divinations and enchantments, and they will be sold to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah to Irritate him.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Jehovah will be greatly angry against Israel, and he will remove them from his face: not to leave only the tribe of Judah alone.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Also Judah watched not the commands of Jehovah their God, and they will go in the laws of Israel which they made.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Jehovah will reject in all the seed of Israel, and will afflict them, and he will give them into the hand of plunderers, till he cast them from his face.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For he rent Israel from above the house of David; and they will make Jeroboam son of Nebat, king; and Jeroboam will thrust out Israel king after Jehovah, and he caused them to sin a great sin.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the sons of Israel will go in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they turned not away from them;</verse>
  <verse number="23">Till Jehovah removed Israel from his face, as he spake by the hand of all his servants the prophets. And he will carry Israel into exile from his land to Assur, even to this day.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And the king of Assur will come from Babel and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and sepharvaim, and he will set in the cities of Shomeron instead of the sons of Israel: and they will possess Shomeron and dwell in her cities.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And it will be in the beginning of their dwelling there, they will not fear Jehovah; and Jehovah will send against them lions, and they will be killing among them.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And they will say to the king of Assur, saying, The nations which thou carriedst into exile, and thou wilt set in the cities of Shomeron, knew not the judgment of the God of the land, and he will send among them lions, and behold them slaying them because they knew not the judgment of the God of the land.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And the king of Assur will command, saying, Carry there one of the priests which ye brought from thence; and they shall go and dwell there, and he shall teach them the judgment of the God of the land.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And one of the priests which they carried into exile from Shomeron will come and dwell in the house of God, and he will be teaching them how they shall fear Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And the nation, nation, will be making his gods, and will put in the house of the heights which the Samaritans made, nation, nation, in their cities which they dwell there.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And the men of Babel made Succoth-Benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath, made Ashima.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites were burning their sons in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And they will be fearing Jehovah, and make to them priests of their ends upon the heights, and they will be doing to them in the houses of the heights.</verse>
  <verse number="33">They were fearing Jehovah, and were serving their gods according to the judgment of the nations who carried them into exile from thence,</verse>
  <verse number="34">Even to this day they are doing according to the former judgments: they not fearing Jehovah, and not doing according to their laws and according to their judgments and according to the instruction and according to the command which Jehovah commanded the sons of Jacob, whom he set his name Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And Jehovah cut out a covenant with them, and he commanded them, saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, and ye shall not worship to them, and ye shall not serve them, and ye shall not sacrifice to them.</verse>
  <verse number="36">But Jehovah who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an extended arm, him shall ye fear, and to him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye sacrifice.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And the laws and the judgments, and the instruction and command which he wrote for you, ye shall watch to do all the days; and ye shall not fear other gods.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And the covenant which I cut out with you ye shall not forget; and ye shall not fear other gods.</verse>
  <verse number="39">But Jehovah your God ye shall fear, and he shall deliver you from the hand of all your enemies.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And they did not hearken, but! they were doing according to their former judgments.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And these nations were fearing Jehovah and were serving their carved images, also their sons and their sons sons; as their fathers did, they are doing even to this day.</verse>
