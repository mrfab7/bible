  <verse number="1">And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, Appointed seasons of Jehovah, which ye proclaim, holy convocations, are these: they are My appointed seasons:</verse>
  <verse number="3">six days is work done, and in the seventh day is a sabbath of rest, a holy convocation; ye do no work; it is a sabbath to Jehovah in all your dwellings.</verse>
  <verse number="4">These are appointed seasons of Jehovah, holy convocations, which ye proclaim in their appointed seasons:</verse>
  <verse number="5">in the first month, on the fourteenth of the month, between the evenings, is the passover to Jehovah;</verse>
  <verse number="6">and on the fifteenth day of this month is the feast of unleavened things to Jehovah; seven days unleavened things ye do eat;</verse>
  <verse number="7">on the first day ye have a holy convocation, ye do no servile work;</verse>
  <verse number="8">and ye have brought near a fire-offering to Jehovah seven days; in the seventh day is a holy convocation; ye do no servile work.’</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="10">‘Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, When ye come in unto the land which I am giving to you, and have reaped its harvest, and have brought in the sheaf, the beginning of your harvest unto the priest,</verse>
  <verse number="11">then he hath waved the sheaf before Jehovah for your acceptance; on the morrow of the sabbath doth the priest wave it.</verse>
  <verse number="12">‘And ye have prepared in the day of your waving the sheaf a lamb, a perfect one, a son of a year, for a burnt-offering to Jehovah,</verse>
  <verse number="13">and its present two tenth deals of flour mixed with oil, a fire-offering to Jehovah, a sweet fragrance, and its drink-offering, wine, a fourth of the hin.</verse>
  <verse number="14">‘And bread and roasted corn and full ears ye do not eat until this self-same day, until your bringing in the offering of your God—a statute age-during to your generations, in all your dwellings.</verse>
  <verse number="15">‘And ye have numbered to you from the morrow of the sabbath, from the day of your bringing in the sheaf of the wave-offering: they are seven perfect sabbaths;</verse>
  <verse number="16">unto the morrow of the seventh sabbath ye do number fifty days, and ye have brought near a new present to Jehovah;</verse>
  <verse number="17">out of your dwellings ye bring in bread of a wave-offering, two loaves, of two tenth deals of flour they are, with yeast they are baken, first -fruits to Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="18">‘And ye have brought near, besides the bread, seven lambs, perfect ones, sons of a year, and one bullock, a son of the herd, and two rams; they are a burnt-offering to Jehovah, with their present and their libations, a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="19">‘And ye have prepared one kid of the goats for a sin-offering, and two lambs, sons of a year, for a sacrifice of peace-offerings,</verse>
  <verse number="20">and the priest hath waved them, besides the bread of the first -fruits—a wave-offering before Jehovah, besides the two lambs; they are holy to Jehovah for the priest;</verse>
  <verse number="21">and ye have proclaimed on this self-same day: a holy convocation is to you, ye do no servile work—a statute age-during in all your dwellings, to your generations.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And in your reaping the harvest of your land thou dost not complete the corner of thy field in thy reaping, and the gleaning of thy harvest thou dost not gather, to the poor and to the sojourner thou dost leave them; I Jehovah am your God.’</verse>
  <verse number="23">And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="24">‘Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, on the first of the month, ye have a sabbath, a memorial of shouting, a holy convocation;</verse>
  <verse number="25">ye do no servile work, and ye have brought near a fire-offering to Jehovah.’</verse>
  <verse number="26">And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="27">‘Only—on the tenth of this seventh month is a day of atonements; ye have a holy convocation, and ye have humbled yourselves, and have brought near a fire-offering to Jehovah;</verse>
  <verse number="28">and ye do no work in this self-same day, for it is a day of atonements, to make atonement for you, before Jehovah your God.</verse>
  <verse number="29">‘For any person who is not humbled in this self-same day hath even been cut off from his people;</verse>
  <verse number="30">and any person who doth any work in this self-same day I have even destroyed that person from the midst of his people;</verse>
  <verse number="31">ye do no work—a statute age-during to your generations in all your dwellings.</verse>
  <verse number="32">It is a sabbath of rest to you, and ye have humbled yourselves in the ninth of the month at even; from evening till evening ye do keep your sabbath.’</verse>
  <verse number="33">And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="34">Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, In the fifteenth day of this seventh month is a feast of booths seven days to Jehovah;</verse>
  <verse number="35">on the first day is a holy convocation, ye do no servile work,</verse>
  <verse number="36">seven days ye bring near a fire-offering to Jehovah, on the eighth day ye have a holy convocation, and ye have brought near a fire-offering to Jehovah; it is a restraint, ye do no servile work.</verse>
  <verse number="37">These are appointed seasons of Jehovah, which ye proclaim holy convocations, to bring near a fire-offering to Jehovah, a burnt-offering, and a present, a sacrifice, and libations, a thing of a day in its day,</verse>
  <verse number="38">apart from the sabbaths of Jehovah, and apart from your gifts, and apart from all your vows, and apart from all your willing-offerings, which ye give to Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="39">Only—in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, in your gathering the increase of the land, ye do keep the feast of Jehovah seven days; on the first day is a sabbath, and on the eighth day a sabbath;</verse>
  <verse number="40">and ye have taken to yourselves on the first day the fruit of beautiful trees, branches of palms, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of a brook, and have rejoiced before Jehovah your God seven days.</verse>
  <verse number="41">‘And ye have kept it a feast to Jehovah, seven days in a year—a statute age-during to your generations; in the seventh month ye keep it a feast.</verse>
  <verse number="42">‘In booths ye dwell seven days; all who are natives in Israel dwell in booths,</verse>
  <verse number="43">so that your generations do know that in booths I caused the sons of Israel to dwell; in my bringing them out of the land of Egypt; I, Jehovah, am your God.’</verse>
  <verse number="44">And Moses speaketh concerning the appointed seasons of Jehovah unto the sons of Israel.</verse>
