<p class="verse" data-verse="1">A soft answer turneth away wrath; But a grievous word stirreth up anger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The tongue of the wise uttereth knowledge aright; But the mouth of fools poureth out folly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The eyes of Jehovah are in every place, Keeping watch upon the evil and the good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">A gentle tongue is a tree of life; But perverseness therein is a breaking of the spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">A fool despiseth his fatherâ€™s correction; But he that regardeth reproof getteth prudence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">In the house of the righteous is much treasure; But in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The lips of the wise disperse knowledge; But the heart of the foolish doeth not so.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to Jehovah; But the prayer of the upright is his delight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The way of the wicked is an abomination to Jehovah; But he loveth him that followeth after righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">There is grievous correction for him that forsaketh the way; And he that hateth reproof shall die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Sheol and Abaddon are before Jehovah: How much more then the hearts of the children of men!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">A scoffer loveth not to be reproved; He will not go unto the wise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">A glad heart maketh a cheerful countenance; But by sorrow of heart the spirit is broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge; But the mouth of fools feedeth on folly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">All the days of the afflicted are evil; But he that is of a cheerful heart hath a continual feast.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Better is little, with the fear of Jehovah, Than great treasure and trouble therewith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Better is a dinner of herbs, where love is, Than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">A wrathful man stirreth up contention; But he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The way of the sluggard is as a hedge of thorns; But the path of the upright is made a highway.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">A wise son maketh a glad father; But a foolish man despiseth his mother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Folly is joy to him that is void of wisdom; But a man of understanding maketh straight his going.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Where there is no counsel, purposes are disappointed; But in the multitude of counsellors they are established.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">A man hath joy in the answer of his mouth; And a word in due season, how good is it!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">To the wise the way of life goeth upward, That he may depart from Sheol beneath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Jehovah will root up the house of the proud; But he will establish the border of the widow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Evil devices are an abomination to Jehovah; But pleasant words are pure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; But he that hateth bribes shall live.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">The heart of the righteous studieth to answer; But the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Jehovah is far from the wicked; But he heareth the prayer of the righteous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart; And good tidings make the bones fat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">The ear that hearkeneth to the reproof of life Shall abide among the wise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">He that refuseth correction despiseth his own soul; But he that hearkeneth to reproof getteth understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">The fear of Jehovah is the instruction of wisdom; And before honor goeth humility.</p>
