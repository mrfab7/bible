<div class="chapter" data-book="Ecclesiastes" data-chapter="7" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">A good name is better than fine perfume, and one’s day of death is better than his day of birth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">It is better to enter a house of mourning than a house of feasting, since death is the end of every man, and the living should take this to heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Sorrow is better than laughter, for a sad countenance is good for the heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">It is better to heed a wise man’s rebuke than to listen to the song of fools.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For like the crackling of thorns under the pot, so is the laughter of the fool. This too is futile.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Surely extortion turns a wise man into a fool, and a bribe corrupts the heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The end of a matter is better than the beginning, and a patient spirit is better than a proud one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Do not be quickly provoked in your spirit, for anger settles in the lap of a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Do not say, “Why were the old days better than these?” For it is unwise of you to ask about this.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Wisdom, like an inheritance, is good, and it benefits those who see the sun.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For wisdom, like money, is a shelter, and the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of its owner.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Consider the work of God: Who can straighten what He has bent?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">In the day of prosperity, be joyful, but in the day of adversity, consider this: God has made one of these along with the other, so that a man cannot discover anything that will come after him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">In my futile life I have seen both of these: A righteous man perishing in his righteousness, and a wicked man living long in his wickedness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Do not be overly righteous, and do not make yourself too wise. Why should you destroy yourself?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Do not be excessively wicked, and do not be a fool. Why should you die before your time?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">It is good to grasp the one and not let the other slip from your hand. For he who fears God will follow both warnings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Wisdom makes the wise man stronger than ten rulers in a city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Surely there is no righteous man on earth who does good and never sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Do not pay attention to every word that is spoken, or you may hear your servant cursing you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For you know in your heart that many times you yourself have cursed others.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">All this I tested by wisdom, saying, “I resolve to be wise.” But it was beyond me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">What exists is out of reach and very deep. Who can fathom it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">I directed my mind to understand, to explore, to search out wisdom and explanations, and to understand the stupidity of wickedness and the folly of madness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And I find more bitter than death the woman who is a snare, whose heart is a net, and whose hands are chains. The man who pleases God escapes her, but the sinner is ensnared.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">“Behold,” says the Teacher, “I have discovered this by adding one thing to another to find an explanation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">While my soul was still searching but not finding, among a thousand I have found one upright man, but among all these I have not found one such woman.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Only this have I found: I have discovered that God made mankind upright, but they have sought out many schemes.”</p>
