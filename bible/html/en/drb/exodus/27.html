<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Thou shalt make also two bars for the altar of setim wood, which thou shalt cover with plates of brass:</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="17">All the pillars of the court round about shall be garnished with plates of silver, silver heads and sockets of brass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">In length the court shall take up a hundred cubits, in breadth fifty, the height shall be of five cubits, and it shall be made of fine twisted linen, and shall have sockets of brass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">All the vessels of the tabernacle for all uses and ceremonies, and the pins both of it, and of the court, thou shalt make of brass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Command the children of Israel that they bring thee the purest oil of the olives, and beaten with a pestle: that a lamp may burn always,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">In the tabernacle of the testimony without the veil that hangs before the testimony. And Aaron and his sons shall order it, that it may give light before the Lord until the morning. It shall be a perpetual observance throughout their successions among the children of Israel.</p>
