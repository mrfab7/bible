<p class="verse" data-verse="1">After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed his day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Job spoke, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Let the day perish in which I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a mail child conceived.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Let darkness and the shades of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined to the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Let the stars of its twilight be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Because it prevented not my birth, nor hid sorrow from my eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Why died I not from the womb? why did I not expire at the time of my birth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Why did the knees receive me? or why the breasts that I should be nursed?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">With kings and counselors of the earth, who built desolate places for themselves;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary are at rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Why is light given to him that is in misery, and life to the bitter in soul;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Who long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Who rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For the thing which I greatly feared hath come upon me, and that which I dreaded hath come to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.</p>
