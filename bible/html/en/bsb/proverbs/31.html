<p class="verse" data-verse="1">These are the words of King Lemuel—the burden that his mother taught him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">What shall I say, O my son? What, O son of my womb? What, O son of my vows?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Do not spend your strength on women or your vigor on those who ruin kings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, or for rulers to crave strong drink,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">lest they drink and forget what is decreed, depriving all the oppressed of justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Give strong drink to one who is perishing, and wine to the bitter in soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Let him drink and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Open your mouth for those with no voice, for the cause of all the dispossessed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Open your mouth, judge righteously, and defend the cause of the poor and needy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">A wife of noble character, who can find? She is far more precious than rubies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The heart of her husband trusts in her, and he lacks nothing of value.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">She brings him good and not harm all the days of her life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">She selects wool and flax and works with eager hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from afar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">She rises while it is still night to provide food for her household and portions for her maidservants.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">She appraises a field and buys it; from her earnings she plants a vineyard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">She girds herself with strength and shows that her arms are strong.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">She sees that her gain is good, and her lamp is not extinguished at night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">She stretches out her hands to the distaff and grasps the spindle with her fingers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">She opens her arms to the poor and reaches out her hands to the needy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">When it snows, she has no fear for her household, for they are all clothed in scarlet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">She makes coverings for her bed; her clothing is fine linen and purple.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Her husband is known at the city gates, where he sits among the elders of the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">She makes linen garments and sells them; she delivers sashes to the merchants.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Strength and honor are her clothing, and she can laugh at the days to come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">She opens her mouth with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband praises her as well:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">“Many daughters have done noble things, but you surpass them all!”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting, but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Give her the fruit of her hands, and let her works praise her at the gates.</p>
