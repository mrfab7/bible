<p class="verse" data-verse="1">A wise son is the doctrine of his father. But he who ridicules does not listen when he is reproved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">From the fruit of his own month, a man shall be satisfied with good things. But the soul of betrayers is iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Whoever guards his mouth guards his soul. But whoever gives no consideration to his speech shall experience misfortunes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The lazy one is willing and then not willing. But the soul of he who labors shall be made fat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The just shall detest a lying word. But the impious confound and will be confounded.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Justice guards the way of the innocent. But impiety undermines the sinner.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">One is like the rich, though he has nothing. And another is like the poor, though he has many riches.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The redemption of a manâ€™s life is his riches. But he who is poor cannot tolerate correction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The light of the just enriches. But the lamp of the impious will be extinguished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Among the arrogant, there are always conflicts. But those who do everything with counsel are ruled by wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Substance obtained in haste will be diminished. But what is collected by hand, little by little, shall be multiplied.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Hope, when it is delayed, afflicts the soul. The arrival of the desired is a tree of life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Whoever denounces something obligates himself for the future. But whoever fears a lesson shall turn away in peace. Deceitful souls wander into sins. The just are merciful and compassionate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The law of the wise is a fountain of life, so that he may turn aside from the ruin of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Good doctrine bestows grace. In the way of the contemptuous, there is a chasm.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The discerning do everything with counsel. But whoever is senseless discloses his stupidity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The messenger of the impious will fall into evil. But a faithful ambassador shall prosper.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Destitution and disgrace are for those who abandon discipline. But whoever agrees with a reproof shall be glorified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The desired, when perfected, shall delight the soul. The foolish detest those who flee from evils.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Whoever keeps step with the wise shall be wise. A friend of the foolish will become like them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Evil pursues sinners. And good things shall be distributed to the just.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The good leave behind heirs: children and grandchildren. And the substance of the sinner is preserved for the just.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Much nourishment is in the fallow land of the fathers. But for others, it is gathered without judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He who spares the rod hates his son. But he who loves him urgently instructs him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The just eats and fills his soul. But the belly of the impious is never satisfied.</p>
