<div class="chapter" data-book="Isaiah" data-chapter="33" data-translation="JPS Tanakh 1917 OT" data-translation-id="jps" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; And dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! When thou hast ceased to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; And when thou art weary with dealing treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">O LORD, be gracious unto us; We have waited for Thee; Be Thou their arm every morning, Our salvation also in the time of trouble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">At the noise of the tumult the peoples are fled; At the lifting up of Thyself the nations are scattered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And your spoil is gathered as the caterpillar gathereth; As locusts leap do they leap upon it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The LORD is exalted, for He dwelleth on high; He hath filled Zion with justice and righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the stability of thy times shall be A hoard of salvation—wisdom and knowledge, And the fear of the LORD which is His treasure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Behold, their valiant ones cry without; The ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The highways lie waste, The wayfaring man ceaseth; He hath broken the covenant, He hath despised the cities, He regardeth not man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The land mourneth and languisheth; Lebanon is ashamed, it withereth; Sharon is like a wilderness; And Bashan and Carmel are clean bare.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Now will I arise, saith the LORD; Now will I be exalted; Now will I lift Myself up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Ye conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble; Your breath is a fire that shall devour you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And the peoples shall be as the burnings of lime; As thorns cut down, that are burned in the fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; And, ye that are near, acknowledge My might.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The sinners in Zion are afraid; Trembling hath seized the ungodly: ‘Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? Who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; He that despiseth the gain of oppressions, That shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, That stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, And shutteth his eyes from looking upon evil;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He shall dwell on high; His place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks; His bread shall be given, his waters shall be sure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty; They shall behold a land stretching afar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Thy heart shall muse on the terror: ‘Where is he that counted, where is he that weighed? Where is he that counted the towers?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Thou shalt not see the fierce people; A people of a deep speech that thou canst not perceive, Of a stammering tongue that thou canst not understand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Look upon Zion, the city of our solemn gatherings; Thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a peaceful habitation, A tent that shall not be removed, The stakes whereof shall never be plucked up, Neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">But there the LORD will be with us in majesty, In a place of broad rivers and streams; Wherein shall go no galley with oars, Neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For the LORD is our Judge, The LORD is our Lawgiver, The LORD is our King; He will save us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Thy tacklings are loosed; They do not hold the stand of their mast, They do not spread the sail; Then is the prey of a great spoil divided; The lame take the prey.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And the inhabitant shall not say: ‘I am sick’; The people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.</p>
