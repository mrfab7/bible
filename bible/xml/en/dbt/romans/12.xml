  <verse number="1">I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the compassions of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, [which is] your intelligent service.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of [your] mind, that ye may prove what [is] the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For I say, through the grace which has been given to me, to every one that is among you, not to have high thoughts above what he should think; but to think so as to be wise, as God has dealt to each a measure of faith.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For, as in one body we have many members, but all the members have not the same office;</verse>
  <verse number="5">thus we, [being] many, are one body in Christ, and each one members one of the other.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But having different gifts, according to the grace which has been given to us, whether [it be] prophecy, [let us prophesy] according to the proportion of faith;</verse>
  <verse number="7">or service, [let us occupy ourselves] in service; or he that teaches, in teaching;</verse>
  <verse number="8">or he that exhorts, in exhortation; he that gives, in simplicity; he that leads, with diligence; he that shews mercy, with cheerfulness.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Let love be unfeigned; abhorring evil; cleaving to good:</verse>
  <verse number="10">as to brotherly love, kindly affectioned towards one another: as to honour, each taking the lead in paying it to the other:</verse>
  <verse number="11">as to diligent zealousness, not slothful; in spirit fervent; serving the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="12">As regards hope, rejoicing: as regards tribulation, enduring: as regards prayer, persevering:</verse>
  <verse number="13">distributing to the necessities of the saints; given to hospitality.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Bless them that persecute you; bless, and curse not.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Rejoice with those that rejoice, weep with those that weep.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Have the same respect one for another, not minding high things, but going along with the lowly: be not wise in your own eyes:</verse>
  <verse number="17">recompensing to no one evil for evil: providing things honest before all men:</verse>
  <verse number="18">if possible, as far as depends on you, living in peace with all men;</verse>
  <verse number="19">not avenging yourselves, beloved, but give place to wrath; for it is written, Vengeance [belongs] to me, I will recompense, saith the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="20">If therefore thine enemy should hunger, feed him; if he should thirst, give him drink; for, so doing, thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.</verse>
