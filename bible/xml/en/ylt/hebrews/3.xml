<chapter book="Hebrews" number="3" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the apostle and chief priest of our profession, Christ Jesus,</verse>
  <verse number="2">being stedfast to Him who did appoint him, as also Moses in all his house,</verse>
  <verse number="3">for of more glory than Moses hath this one been counted worthy, inasmuch as more honour than the house hath he who doth build it,</verse>
  <verse number="4">for every house is builded by some one, and He who the all things did build is God,</verse>
  <verse number="5">and Moses indeed was stedfast in all his house, as an attendant, for a testimony of those things that were to be spoken,</verse>
  <verse number="6">and Christ, as a Son over his house, whose house are we, if the boldness and the rejoicing of the hope unto the end we hold fast.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Wherefore, (as the Holy Spirit saith, ‘To-day, if His voice ye may hear—</verse>
  <verse number="8">ye may not harden your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of the temptation in the wilderness,</verse>
  <verse number="9">in which tempt Me did your fathers, they did prove Me, and saw My works forty years;</verse>
  <verse number="10">wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, Always do they go astray in heart, and these have not known My ways;</verse>
  <verse number="11">so I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest—!’)</verse>
  <verse number="12">See, brethren, lest there shall be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in the falling away from the living God,</verse>
  <verse number="13">but exhort ye one another every day, while the To-day is called, that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of the sin,</verse>
  <verse number="14">for partakers we have become of the Christ, if the beginning of the confidence unto the end we may hold fast,</verse>
  <verse number="15">in its being said, ‘To-day, if His voice ye may hear, ye may not harden your hearts, as in the provocation,’</verse>
  <verse number="16">for certain having heard did provoke, but not all who did come out of Egypt through Moses;</verse>
  <verse number="17">but with whom was He grieved forty years? was it not with those who did sin, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?</verse>
  <verse number="18">and to whom did He swear that they shall not enter into His rest, except to those who did not believe?—</verse>
  <verse number="19">and we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.</verse>
