<p class="verse" data-verse="1">LET every soul be subject to higher powers: for there is no power but from God: and those that are, are ordained of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Therefore he that resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God. And they that resist, purchase to themselves damnation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For princes are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good: and thou shalt have praise from the same.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For he is God’s minister to thee, for good. But if thou do that which is evil, fear: for he beareth not the sword in vain. For he is God’s minister: an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Wherefore be subject of necessity, not only for wrath, but also for conscience’ sake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For therefore also you pay tribute. For they are the ministers of God, serving unto this purpose.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Render therefore to all men their dues. Tribute, to whom tribute is due: custom, to whom custom: fear, to whom fear: honour, to whom honour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Owe no man any thing, but to love one another. For he that loveth his neighbour, hath fulfilled the law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For Thou shalt not commit adultery: Thou shalt not kill: Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness: Thou shalt not covet: and if there be any other commandment, it is comprised in this word, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The love of our neighbour worketh no evil. Love therefore is the fulfilling of the law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And that knowing the season; that it is now the hour for us to rise from sleep. For now our salvation is nearer than when we believed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The night is passed, and the day is at hand. Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and put on the armour of light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Let us walk honestly, as in the day: not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and impurities, not in contention and envy:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh in its concupiscences.</p>
