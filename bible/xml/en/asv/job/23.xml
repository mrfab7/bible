  <verse number="1">Then Job answered and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Even to-day is my complaint rebellious: My stroke is heavier than my groaning.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Oh that I knew where I might find him! That I might come even to his seat!</verse>
  <verse number="4">I would set my cause in order before him, And fill my mouth with arguments.</verse>
  <verse number="5">I would know the words which he would answer me, And understand what he would say unto me.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power? Nay; but he would give heed unto me.</verse>
  <verse number="7">There the upright might reason with him; So should I be delivered for ever from my judge.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; And backward, but I cannot perceive him;</verse>
  <verse number="9">On the left hand, when he doth work, but I cannot behold him; He hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But he knoweth the way that I take; When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.</verse>
  <verse number="11">My foot hath held fast to his steps; His way have I kept, and turned not aside.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I have not gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? And what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For he performeth that which is appointed for me: And many such things are with him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Therefore am I terrified at his presence; When I consider, I am afraid of him.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For God hath made my heart faint, And the Almighty hath terrified me;</verse>
  <verse number="17">Because I was not cut off before the darkness, Neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face.</verse>
