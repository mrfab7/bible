  <verse number="1">Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, to obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you, and peace, be multiplied.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again to a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,</verse>
  <verse number="4">To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in heaven for you,</verse>
  <verse number="5">Who are kept by the power of God through faith to salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, you are in heaviness through manifold temptations:</verse>
  <verse number="7">That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perishes, though it be tried with fire, might be found to praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:</verse>
  <verse number="8">Whom having not seen, you love; in whom, though now you see him not, yet believing, you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:</verse>
  <verse number="9">Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come to you:</verse>
  <verse number="11">Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.</verse>
  <verse number="12">To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they did minister the things, which are now reported to you by them that have preached the gospel to you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Why gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="14">As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:</verse>
  <verse number="15">But as he which has called you is holy, so be you holy in all manner of conversation;</verse>
  <verse number="16">Because it is written, Be you holy; for I am holy.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And if you call on the Father, who without respect of persons judges according to every man’s work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear:</verse>
  <verse number="18">For as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;</verse>
  <verse number="19">But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:</verse>
  <verse number="20">Who truly was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,</verse>
  <verse number="21">Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit to unfeigned love of the brothers, see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently:</verse>
  <verse number="23">Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which lives and stays for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="24">For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass wither, and the flower thereof falls away:</verse>
  <verse number="25">But the word of the Lord endures for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached to you.</verse>
