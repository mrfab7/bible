  <verse number="1">Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the names of his daughters; Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="3">Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah; but died in his own sin, and had no sons.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family, because he has no son? Give to us therefore a possession among the brothers of our father.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Moses brought their cause before the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="7">The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: you shall surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father’s brothers; and you shall cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And you shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And if he have no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And if he have no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father’s brothers.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And if his father have no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it: and it shall be to the children of Israel a statute of judgment, as the LORD commanded Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the LORD said to Moses, Get you up into this mount Abarim, and see the land which I have given to the children of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And when you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother was gathered.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For you rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water before their eyes: that is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Moses spoke to the LORD, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="16">Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation,</verse>
  <verse number="17">Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them, and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that the congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no shepherd.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the LORD said to Moses, Take you Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and lay your hand on him;</verse>
  <verse number="19">And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And you shall put some of your honor on him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And Moses did as the LORD commanded him: and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation:</verse>
  <verse number="23">And he laid his hands on him, and gave him a charge, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.</verse>
