  <verse number="1">Therefore be imitators of God, as His dear children.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And live and act lovingly, as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up to death on our behalf as an offering and sacrifice to God, yielding a fragrant odor.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But fornication and every kind of impurity, or covetousness, let them not even be mentioned among you, for they ought not to be named among God’s people.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Avoid shameful and foolish talk and low jesting—they are all alike discreditable—and in place of these give thanks.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For be well assured that no fornicator or immoral person and no money-grubber—or in other words idol-worshipper—has any share awaiting him in the Kingdom of Christ and of God.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Let no one deceive you with empty words, for it is on account of these very sins that God’s anger is coming upon the disobedient.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Therefore do not become sharers with them.</verse>
  <verse number="8">There was a time when you were nothing but darkness. Now, as Christians, you are Light itself.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Live and act as sons of Light—for the effect of the Light is seen in every kind of goodness, uprightness and truth—</verse>
  <verse number="10">and learn in your own experiences what is fully pleasing to the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Have nothing to do with the barren unprofitable deeds of darkness, but, instead of that, set your faces against them;</verse>
  <verse number="12">for the things which are done by these people in secret it is disgraceful even to speak of.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But everything can be tested by the light and thus be shown in its true colors; for whatever shines of itself is light.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For this reason it is said, “Rise, sleeper; rise from among the dead, and Christ will shed light upon you.”</verse>
  <verse number="15">Therefore be very careful how you live and act. Let it not be as unwise men, but as wise.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Buy up your opportunities, for these are evil times.</verse>
  <verse number="17">On this account do not prove yourselves wanting in sense, but try to understand what the Lord’s will is.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Do not over-indulge in wine—a thing in which excess is so easy—</verse>
  <verse number="19">but drink deeply of God’s Spirit. Speak to one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. Sing and offer praise in your hearts to the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Always and for everything let your thanks to God the Father be presented in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="21">and submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Married women, submit to your own husbands as if to the Lord;</verse>
  <verse number="23">because a husband is the Head of his wife as Christ also is the Head of the Church, being indeed the Saviour of this His Body.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And just as the Church submits to Christ, so also married women should be entirely submissive to their husbands.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Married men, love your wives, as Christ also loved the Church and gave Himself up to death for her;</verse>
  <verse number="26">in order to make her holy, cleansing her with the baptismal water by the word,</verse>
  <verse number="27">that He might present the Church to Himself a glorious bride, without spot or wrinkle or any other defect, but to be holy and unblemished.</verse>
  <verse number="28">So too married men ought to love their wives as much as they love themselves. He who loves his wife loves himself.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For never yet has a man hated his own body. On the contrary he feeds and cherishes it, just as Christ feeds and cherishes the Church;</verse>
  <verse number="30">because we are, as it were, parts of His Body.</verse>
  <verse number="31">“For this reason a man is to leave his father and his mother and be united to his wife, and the two shall be as one.”</verse>
  <verse number="32">That is a great truth hitherto kept secret: I mean the truth concerning Christ and the Church.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Yet I insist that among you also, each man is to love his own wife as much as he loves himself, and let a married woman see to it that she treats her husband with respect.</verse>
