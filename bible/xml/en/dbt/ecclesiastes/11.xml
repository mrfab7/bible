  <verse number="1">Cast thy bread upon the waters; for thou shalt find it after many days.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="3">If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth; and if a tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.</verse>
  <verse number="4">He that observeth the wind will not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds will not reap.</verse>
  <verse number="5">As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, how the bones [grow] in the womb of her that is with child, even so thou knowest not the work of God who maketh all.</verse>
  <verse number="6">In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thy hand; for thou knowest not which shall prosper, whether this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Now the light is sweet, and pleasant is it to the eyes to see the sun;</verse>
  <verse number="8">but if a man live many years, [and] rejoice in them all, yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many: all that cometh is vanity.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Rejoice, young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes; but know that for all these [things] God will bring thee into judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Then remove discontent from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh; for childhood and youth are vanity.</verse>
