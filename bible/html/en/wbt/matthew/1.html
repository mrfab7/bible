<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Judah begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Uriah;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon to Christ are fourteen generations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Now the birth of Jesus Christ was in this manner: When his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, purposed to put her away privately.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But while he thought on these things, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take to thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken from the Lord by the prophet, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Then Joseph, being raised from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took to him his wife:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And knew her not till she had brought forth her first-born son: and he called his name JESUS.</p>
