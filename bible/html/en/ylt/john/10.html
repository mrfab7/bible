<div class="chapter" data-book="John" data-chapter="10" data-translation="Young's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="ylt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">‘Verily, verily, I say to you, He who is not entering through the door to the fold of the sheep, but is going up from another side, that one is a thief and a robber;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and he who is entering through the door is shepherd of the sheep;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">to this one the doorkeeper doth open, and the sheep hear his voice, and his own sheep he doth call by name, and doth lead them forth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">and when his own sheep he may put forth, before them he goeth on, and the sheep follow him, because they have known his voice;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">and a stranger they will not follow, but will flee from him, because they have not known the voice of strangers.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">This similitude spake Jesus to them, and they knew not what the things were that he was speaking to them;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Jesus said therefore again to them, ‘Verily, verily, I say to you—I am the door of the sheep;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">all, as many as came before me, are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">I am the door, through me if any one may come in, he shall be saved, and he shall come in, and go out, and find pasture.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The thief doth not come, except that he may steal, and kill, and destroy; I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">‘I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd his life layeth down for the sheep;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">and the hireling, and not being a shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, doth behold the wolf coming, and doth leave the sheep, and doth flee; and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">and the hireling doth flee because he is an hireling, and is not caring for the sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I am the good shepherd, and I know my sheep, and am known by mine,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">according as the Father doth know me, and I know the Father, and my life I lay down for the sheep,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">and other sheep I have that are not of this fold, these also it behoveth me to bring, and my voice they will hear, and there shall become one flock—one shepherd.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">‘Because of this doth the Father love me, because I lay down my life, that again I may take it;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">no one doth take it from me, but I lay it down of myself; authority I have to lay it down, and authority I have again to take it; this command I received from my Father.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Therefore, again, there came a division among the Jews, because of these words,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">and many of them said, ‘He hath a demon, and is mad, why do ye hear him?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">others said, ‘These sayings are not those of a demoniac; is a demon able blind men’s eyes to open?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And the dedication in Jerusalem came, and it was winter,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the porch of Solomon,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">the Jews, therefore, came round about him, and said to him, ‘Till when our soul dost thou hold in suspense? if thou art the Christ, tell us freely.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Jesus answered them, ‘I told you, and ye do not believe; the works that I do in the name of my Father, these testify concerning me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">but ye do not believe, for ye are not of my sheep,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">according as I said to you: My sheep my voice do hear, and I know them, and they follow me,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">and life age-during I give to them, and they shall not perish—to the age, and no one shall pluck them out of my hand;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">my Father, who hath given to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to pluck out of the hand of my Father;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">I and the Father are one.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Therefore, again, did the Jews take up stones that they may stone him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Jesus answered them, ‘Many good works did I shew you from my Father; because of which work of them do ye stone me?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">The Jews answered him, saying, ‘For a good work we do not stone thee, but for evil speaking, and because thou, being a man, dost make thyself God.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Jesus answered them, ‘Is it not having been written in your law: I said, ye are gods?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">if them he did call gods unto whom the word of God came, (and the Writing is not able to be broken,)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">of him whom the Father did sanctify, and send to the world, do ye say—Thou speakest evil, because I said, Son of God I am?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">if I do not the works of my Father, do not believe me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">and if I do, even if me ye may not believe, the works believe, that ye may know and may believe that in me is the Father, and I in Him.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Therefore were they seeking again to seize him, and he went forth out of their hand,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">and went away again to the other side of the Jordan, to the place where John was at first baptizing, and remained there,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">and many came unto him, and said—‘John, indeed, did no sign, and all things, as many as John said about this one were true;’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">and many did believe in him there.</p>
