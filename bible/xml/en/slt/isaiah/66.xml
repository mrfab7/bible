  <verse number="1">Thus said Jehovah, The heavens my throne, and the earth the footstool of my feet: where this house which ye will build to me? and where this place of my rest?</verse>
  <verse number="2">And all these my hand made, and all these shall be, says Jehovah: and to this will I look, to the humble and smitten of spirit, and trembling at my word.</verse>
  <verse number="3">He slaughtering the ox, striking a man; he sacrificing a sheep, broke a dog’s neck; he bringing up a gift, swine’s blood; he making remembrance of frankincense, praising vanity; also they chose their ways, and in their abominations their soul delighted.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Also I will choose upon their vexations, and I will bring their fears to them; for I called, and none answered; I spake, and they heard not: and they will do evil in mine eyes, and in what I delighted not, they chose.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Hear the word of Jehovah, ye trembling at his word: Your brethren hating you, excluding you for sake of my name, said, Jehovah shall be honored: and he was seen to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.</verse>
  <verse number="6">A voice of uproar from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of Jehovah requiting retribution to his enemies.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Bringing forth before she will travail, before pain will come to her, she was delivered of a male.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Who heard such as this? who saw such as these things? shall the earth be made to travail in one day? if a nation shall be brought forth at once? for Zion was pained, she also brought forth her sons.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Shall I cause to break and not cause to bring forth? will Jehovah say: If I cause to bring forth and did I shut up? said thy God.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad in her, all ye loving her: rejoice with her from joy, all ye mourning over her:</verse>
  <verse number="11">So that ye shall suck and be satisfied from the breast of her consolation; so that ye shall press out and be delighted from the brightness of her glory.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For thus said Jehovah, Behold me extending peace to her as a river, and as a torrent flowing to the glory of the nations: and ye sucked, ye shall be lifted upon the side, and ye shall be caressed Upon the knees.</verse>
  <verse number="13">As a man whom his mother shall comfort him, so will I comfort you; and in Jerusalem ye shall be comforted.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And ye saw, and your heart rejoiced, and your bones shall break forth as the tender grass: and the hand of Jehovah was known with his servants, and his wrath to his enemies.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For behold, Jehovah will come with fire, and his chariots as a whirlwind, to turn back in the wrath of his anger, and his rebuke in flames of fire.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For with fire and with sword Jehovah judged all flesh: and the wounded of Jehovah were many.</verse>
  <verse number="17">They consecrating themselves and cleansing themselves in the gardens, behind one in the midst, eating swine’s flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse; together shall they perish, says Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And I come to gather together all nations and tongues, their works and their purposes; and they came and saw my glory.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And I set a sign among them and I sent those escaping of them to the nations, Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, drawing the bow, Tubal and Javan, the isles far off, that heard not my report, and saw not my glory; and they announced my glory among the nations.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And they brought all your brethren out of all the nations a gift to Jehovah, upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift camels, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, said Jehovah, as the sons of Israel shall bring a gift in a clean vessel to the house of Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And I also will take from them for priests, for Levites, said Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For as the new heavens and the new earth which I made, standing before me, says Jehovah, so shall stand your seed and your name.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And it was as often as the new moon in its new moon, and as often as the Sabbath in its Sabbath, all flesh shall come to worship before me, says Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And they went forth and saw the carcasses of the men transgressing against me: for their worm shall not die, and their fire shall not be quenched; and they were an abhorrence to all flesh.</verse>
