<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Jude, servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to the consecrated in God the Father, and the kept in Jesus Christ, the called:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Mercy to you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Dearly beloved, making all diligence to write to you of the common salvation, I had necessity to write to you, beseeching to fight for the faith once delivered to the holy ones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For certain men entered in by stealth, long ago written of beforehand for judgment, irreligious, having changed the grace of our God into licentiousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And I wish to remind you, ye having once known this, that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, the second time destroyed them not having believed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Also the angels not having kept their beginning, but having left their own habitation, he has kept in perpetual chains under darkness for the judgment of the great day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">As Sodom and Gomorrha and the cities about them, debauched in like manner to these, and having gone away after other flesh, are set before a sample of eternal fire, enduring punishment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And likewise indeed these dreaming truly defile the flesh, and despise dominion, and defame glories.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But Michael the archangel, when fighting with the accuser, discussed concerning the body of Moses, dared not to bring the judgment of defamation, but said, May the Lord censure thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And these truly what things they know not they defame: and what things naturally, as irrational animals, they know, in these they corrupt themselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Woe to them for they went in the way of Cain, and were poured out in the error of Balaam for a reward, and they were destroyed in the controversy of Core.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">These are spots in your loves, feasting together fearlessly, taking care of themselves: clouds wanting water, carried about by winds; decayed trees, unfruitful, twice dead, uprooted;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Fierce waves of the sea, foaming out their own shames; wandering stars, to whom the obscurity of darkness has been kept forever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And also of these prophesied Enoch, the seventh from Adam, saying, Behold, the Lord came with ten thousands of his holy ones,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">To do judgment to all, and to convince all their irreligious of all their works of irreligion which they have impiously acted, and of all the hard things which the sinful irreligious spake against him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">These are murmurers, discontented, going according to their eager desires; and their mouth speaks exceeding bulky things, admiring faces on account of advantage.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And ye, dearly beloved, remember the words spoken before by the sent of our Lord Jesus Christ;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For they said to you that in the last time shall be deceivers, going according to the eager desires of their impieties.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">These are they separating themselves, sensual, not having the Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And ye, dearly beloved, building up yourselves in your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Keep yourselves in the love of God, awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And truly compassionate some, discriminating:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And some save in fear, snatching out of the fire; hating also the coat stained from the flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And to him able to watch yourselves from falling, and to place blameless before his glory with transport of joy,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">To the only wise God our Saviour, glory and majesty, and strength and power, also for now and for all times. Amen.</p>
