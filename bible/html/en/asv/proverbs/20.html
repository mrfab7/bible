<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler; And whosoever erreth thereby is not wise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The terror of a king is as the roaring of a lion: He that provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife; But every fool will be quarrelling.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The sluggard will not plow by reason of the winter; Therefore he shall beg in harvest, and have nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; But a man of understanding will draw it out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Most men will proclaim every one his own kindness; But a faithful man who can find?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">A righteous man that walketh in his integrity, Blessed are his children after him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">A king that sitteth on the throne of judgment Scattereth away all evil with his eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Diverse weights, and diverse measures, Both of them alike are an abomination to Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Even a child maketh himself known by his doings, Whether his work be pure, and whether it be right.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, Jehovah hath made even both of them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Love not sleep, let thou come to poverty; Open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">It is bad, it is bad, saith the buyer; But when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">There is gold, and abundance of rubies; But the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Take his garment that is surety for a stranger; And hold him in pledge that is surety for foreigners.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Bread of falsehood is sweet to a man; But afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Every purpose is established by counsel; And by wise guidance make thou war.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He that goeth about as a tale-bearer revealeth secrets; Therefore company not with him that openeth wide his lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Whoso curseth his father or his mother, His lamp shall be put out in blackness of darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; But the end thereof shall not be blessed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Say not thou, I will recompense evil: Wait for Jehovah, and he will save thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Diverse weights are an abomination to Jehovah; And a false balance is not good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">A manâ€™s goings are of Jehovah; How then can man understand his way?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">It is a snare to a man rashly to say, It is holy, And after vows to make inquiry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">A wise king winnoweth the wicked, And bringeth the threshing- wheel over them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah, Searching all his innermost parts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Kindness and truth preserve the king; And his throne is upholden by kindness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">The glory of young men is their strength; And the beauty of old men is the hoary head.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Stripes that wound cleanse away evil; And strokes reach the innermost parts.</p>
