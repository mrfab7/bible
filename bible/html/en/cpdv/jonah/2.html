<div class="chapter" data-book="Jonah" data-chapter="2" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Jonah prayed to the Lord, his God, from the belly of the fish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And he said: “I cried out to the Lord from my tribulation, and he heeded me. From the belly of hell, I cried out, and you heeded my voice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And you have thrown me into the deep, in the heart of the sea, and a flood has encircled me. All your whirlpools and your waves have passed over me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And I said: I am expelled from the sight of your eyes. Yet, truly, I will see your holy temple again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The waters surrounded me, even to the soul. The abyss has walled me in. The ocean has covered my head.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I descended to the base of the mountains. The bars of the earth have enclosed me forever. And you will raise up my life from corruption, Lord, my God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">When my soul was in anguish within me, I called to mind the Lord, so that my prayer might come to you, to your holy temple.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Those who in vain observe vanities, abandon their own mercy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But I, with a voice of praise, will sacrifice to you. I will repay whatever I have vowed to the Lord, because of my salvation.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the Lord spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land.</p>
