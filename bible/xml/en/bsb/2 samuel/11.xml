<chapter book="2 Samuel" number="11" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">In the spring, at the time when kings march out to war, David sent out Joab and his servants with the whole army of Israel. They destroyed the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah, but David remained in Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="2">One evening David got up from his bed and strolled around on the roof of the palace. And from the roof he saw a woman bathing—a very beautiful woman.</verse>
  <verse number="3">So David sent and inquired about the woman, and he was told, “This is Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite.”</verse>
  <verse number="4">Then David sent messengers to get her, and when she came to him, he slept with her. (Now she had just purified herself from her uncleanness.) Then she returned home.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the woman conceived and sent word to David, saying, “I am pregnant.”</verse>
  <verse number="6">At this, David sent orders to Joab: “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” So Joab sent him to David.</verse>
  <verse number="7">When Uriah came to him, David asked how Joab and the troops were doing and how the war was going.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Then he said to Uriah, “Go down to your house and wash your feet.” So Uriah left the palace, and a gift from the king followed him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But Uriah slept at the door of the palace with all his master’s servants; he did not go down to his house.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And David was told, “Uriah did not go home.” “Haven’t you just arrived from a journey?” David asked Uriah. “Why didn’t you go home?”</verse>
  <verse number="11">Uriah answered, “The ark and Israel and Judah are dwelling in tents, and my master Joab and his soldiers are camped in the open field. How can I go to my house to eat and drink and sleep with my wife? As surely as you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do such a thing!”</verse>
  <verse number="12">“Stay here one more day,” David said to Uriah, “and tomorrow I will send you back.” So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then David invited Uriah to eat and drink with him, and he got Uriah drunk. And in the evening Uriah went out to lie down on his cot with his master’s servants, but he did not go home.</verse>
  <verse number="14">The next morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it with Uriah.</verse>
  <verse number="15">In the letter he wrote: “Put Uriah at the front of the fiercest battle; then withdraw from him, so that he may be struck down and killed.”</verse>
  <verse number="16">So as Joab besieged the city, he assigned Uriah to a place where he knew the strongest enemy soldiers were.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And when the men of the city came out and fought against Joab, some of David’s servants fell, and Uriah the Hittite also died.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Joab sent to David a full account of the battle</verse>
  <verse number="19">and instructed the messenger, “When you have finished giving the king a full account of the battle,</verse>
  <verse number="20">if the king’s anger flares, he may ask you, ‘Why did you get so close to the city to fight? Did you not realize they would shoot from atop the wall?</verse>
  <verse number="21">Who struck Abimelech son of Jerubbesheth? Was it not a woman who dropped an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died in Thebez? Why did you get so close to the wall?’ If he asks you this, then you are to say, ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead as well.’”</verse>
  <verse number="22">So the messenger set out and reported to David all that Joab had sent him to say.</verse>
  <verse number="23">The messenger said to David, “The men overpowered us and came out against us in the field, but we drove them back to the entrance of the gate.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Then the archers shot at your servants from the wall, and some of the king’s servants were killed. And your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead as well.”</verse>
  <verse number="25">Then David told the messenger, “Say this to Joab: ‘Do not let this matter upset you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Strengthen your attack against the city and demolish it.’ Encourage him with these words.”</verse>
  <verse number="26">When Uriah’s wife heard that her husband was dead, she mourned for him.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And when the time of mourning was over, David had her brought to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done was evil in the sight of the LORD.</verse>
