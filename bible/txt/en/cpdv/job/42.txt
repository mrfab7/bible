1	Then Job, responding to the Lord, said:
2	I know that you are able to do all things, and that no thoughts are hidden from you.
3	So, who is it that would disguise a lack of knowledge as counsel? Therefore, I have been speaking foolishly, about things whose measure exceeds my knowledge.
4	Listen, and I will speak. I will question you, and you may answer me.
5	By paying attention with the ear, I have heard you, but now my eye sees you.
6	Therefore, I find myself reprehensible, and I will do penance in embers and ashes.
7	But after the Lord had finished speaking these words to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Themanite: My wrath has been kindled against you, and against your two friends, because you have not been speaking correctly in my eyes, as my servant Job has done.
8	Therefore, have seven bulls and seven rams brought to you, and go to my servant Job, and offer these as a holocaust for yourselves. But also, my servant Job will pray for you; I will accept his face, so that foolishness will not be imputed to you. For you have not been speaking correctly about me, as my servant Job has done.
9	So Eliphaz the Themanite, and Baldad the Suhite, and Zophar the Naamathite departed, and they did just as the Lord had spoken to them, and the Lord accepted the face of Job.
10	Likewise, the Lord was moved by the repentance of Job, when he prayed for his friends. And the Lord gave to Job twice as much as he had before.
11	Yet all his brethren came to him, and all his sisters, and everyone who had known him before, and they ate bread with him in his house. They also shook their heads over him and comforted him, because of all the bad things that God had inflicted on him. And each one of them gave him one female sheep, and one earring of gold.
12	And the Lord blessed the latter end of Job even more than his beginning. And he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand pairs of oxen, and a thousand she-donkeys.
13	And he had seven sons and three daughters.
14	And he called the name of one, Daylight, and the name of the second, Cinnamon, and the name of the third, Horn of Cosmetics.
15	And, in the whole world, there were not found women so beautiful as the daughters of Job. And so their father gave them an inheritance along with their brothers.
16	But Job lived long after these events, for a hundred and forty years, and he saw his children, and his children’s children, all the way to the fourth generation,
17	and he died an old man and full of days.

Psalm 49:9	and he will still live, until the end.
Psalm 49:10	He will not see death, when he sees the wise dying: the foolish and the senseless will perish together. And they will leave their riches to strangers.
Psalm 49:11	And their sepulchers will be their houses forever, their tabernacles from generation to generation. They have called their names in their own lands.
Psalm 49:12	And man, when he was held in honor, did not understand. He has been compared to the senseless beasts, and he has become like them.
Psalm 49:13	This way of theirs is a scandal to them. And afterwards, they will delight in their mouth.
Psalm 49:14	They have been placed in Hell like sheep. Death will feed on them. And the just will have dominion over them in the morning. And their help will grow old in Hell for their glory.

Psalm 49:16	Do not be afraid, when a man will have been made rich, and when the glory of his house will have been multiplied.

Psalm 49:19	He will even enter with the progeny of his fathers, but, even in eternity, he will not see the light.
Psalm 49:20	Man, when he was in honor, did not understand. He has been compared to the senseless beasts, and he has become like them.

Psalm 50:14	Offer to God the sacrifice of praise, and pay your vows to the Most High.
Psalm 50:15	And call upon me in the day of tribulation. I will rescue you, and you will honor me.
Psalm 50:16	But to the sinner, God has said: Why do you discourse on my justices, and take up my covenant through your mouth?
Psalm 50:17	Truly, you have hated discipline, and you have cast my sermons behind you.
Psalm 50:18	If you saw a thief, you ran with him, and you have placed your portion with adulterers.
Psalm 50:19	Your mouth has abounded with malice, and your tongue has concocted deceits.
Psalm 50:20	Sitting, you spoke against your brother, and you set up a scandal against your mother’s son.

Psalm 51:3	For I know my iniquity, and my sin is ever before me.

Psalm 51:6	For behold, you have loved truth. The obscure and hidden things of your wisdom, you have manifested to me.

Psalm 52:6	The just will see and be afraid, and they will laugh over him, and say:
Psalm 52:7	“Behold the man who did not set God as his helper. But he hoped in the multitude of his riches, and so he prevailed in his emptiness.”

Psalm 52:9	I will confess to you forever, because you have accomplished it. And I will wait on your name, for it is good in the sight of your saints.

Psalm 55:2	Be attentive to me, and heed me. I have been grieved in my training, and I have been disturbed
Psalm 55:3	at the voice of the adversary and at the tribulation of the sinner. For they have diverted iniquities toward me, and they have been harassing me with rage.

Psalm 55:10	Day and night, iniquity will surround it upon its walls, and hardship is in its midst,
Psalm 55:11	with injustice. And usury and deceit have not fallen away from its streets.

Psalm 55:13	Truly, you are a man of one mind: my leader and my acquaintance,
Psalm 55:14	who took sweet food together with me. In the house of God, we walked side-by-side.
Psalm 55:15	Let death come upon them, and let them descend alive into Hellfire. For there is wickedness in their dwellings, in their midst.
Psalm 55:16	But I have cried out to God, and the Lord will save me.
Psalm 55:17	Evening and morning and midday, I will discourse and announce, and he will heed my voice.
Psalm 55:18	He will redeem my soul in peace from those who draw near to me. For, among the many, they were with me.
Psalm 55:19	God will hear, and He who is before time will humble them. For there is no change with them, and they have not feared God.
Psalm 55:20	He has stretched forth his hand in retribution. They have contaminated his covenant.
Psalm 55:21	They were divided by the wrath of his countenance, and his heart has drawn near. His words are smoother than oil, and they are arrows.
Psalm 55:22	Cast your cares upon the Lord, and he will nurture you. He will not allow the just to be tossed about forever.
Psalm 55:23	Truly, O God, you will lead them away into the well of death. Bloody and deceitful men will not divide their days in half. But I will hope in you, O Lord.

Psalm 56:7	They will dwell and hide themselves. They will watch my heel, just as they waited for my soul;
Psalm 56:8	because of this, nothing will save them. In your anger, you will crush the people.
Psalm 56:9	O God, I have announced my life to you. You have placed my tears in your sight, and even in your promise.
Psalm 56:10	Then my enemies will be turned back. On whatever day that I call upon you, behold, I know that you are my God.
Psalm 56:11	In God, I will praise the word. In the Lord, I will praise his speech. In God, I have hoped. I will not fear what man can do to me.

Psalm 57:1	Unto the end. May you not destroy. Of David, with the inscription of a title, when he fled from Saul into a cave. Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me. For my soul trusts in you. And I will hope in the shadow of your wings, until iniquity passes away.
Psalm 57:2	I will cry out to God Most High, to God who has been kind to me.

Psalm 57:11	Be exalted above the heavens, O God, and your glory above all the earth.
Psalm 58:1	Unto the end. May you not destroy. Of David, with the inscription of a title. If, truly and certainly, you speak justice, then judge what is right, you sons of men.
Psalm 58:2	For, even in your heart, you work iniquity. Your hands construct injustice on the earth.
Psalm 58:3	Sinners have become foreigners from the womb; they have gone astray from conception. They have been speaking falsehoods.
Psalm 58:4	Their fury is similar to that of a serpent; it is like a deaf asp, who even blocks her ears,

For those who will be changed, with the inscription of a title, of David himself, for instruction: when he set fire to Mesopotamia of Syria and Sobal, and Joab turned back and struck Idumea, in the valley of the salt pits, twelve thousand men.

Psalm 63:11	Truly, the king will rejoice in God: all those who swear by him will be praised, because the mouth of those who speak iniquity has been blocked.

Psalm 64:2	You have protected me from the assembly of the malignant, from a multitude of workers of iniquity.
Psalm 64:3	For they have sharpened their tongues like a sword; they have formed their bow into a bitter thing,
Psalm 64:4	so that they may shoot arrows from hiding at the immaculate.
Psalm 64:5	They will suddenly shoot arrows at him, and they will not be afraid. They are resolute in their wicked talk. They have discussed hidden snares. They have said, “Who will see them?”
Psalm 64:6	They have been searching carefully for iniquities. Their exhaustive search has failed. Man will approach with a deep heart,
Psalm 64:7	and God will be exalted. The arrows of the little ones have become their wounds,

Psalm 64:9	and every man was afraid. And they announced the works of God, and they understood his acts.

Psalm 65:5	wonderful in equity. Hear us, O God our Savior, the hope of all the ends of the earth and of a sea far away.
Psalm 65:6	You prepare the mountains in your virtue, wrapped with power.
Psalm 65:7	You stir up the depths of the sea, the noise of its waves. The nations will be troubled,
Psalm 65:8	and those who dwell at the limits will be afraid, before your signs. You will make the passing of morning and evening enjoyable.
Psalm 65:9	You have visited the earth, and you have saturated it. You have enriched it in so many ways. The river of God has been filled with water. You have prepared their food. For thus is its preparation.

Psalm 66:8	Bless our God, you Gentiles, and make the voice of his praise be heard.
Psalm 66:9	He has set my soul toward life, and he has granted that my feet may not be shaken.
Psalm 66:10	For you, O God, have tested us. You have examined us by fire, just as silver is examined.
Psalm 66:11	You have led us into a snare. You have placed tribulations on our back.

Psalm 71:12	O God, do not be far from me. O my God, provide for my assistance.

Psalm 71:19	and your justice, O God, even to the highest great things that you have done. O God, who is like you?

Psalm 72:20	The praises of David, the son of Jesse, have reached an end.
Psalm 73:1	A Psalm of Asaph. How good is God to Israel, to those who are upright in heart.
Psalm 73:2	But my feet were nearly moved; my steps had nearly slipped.
Psalm 73:3	For I was zealous over the iniquitous, seeing the peacefulness of sinners.
Psalm 73:4	For they have no respect for their death, nor do they have support in their wounds.
Psalm 73:5	They are not with the hardships of men, nor will they be scourged with men.
Psalm 73:6	Therefore, arrogance has held on to them. They have been covered with their iniquity and impiety.
Psalm 73:7	Their iniquity has proceeded, as if from fat. They have parted from the affection of the heart.
Psalm 73:8	They have thought and spoken wickedness. They have spoken iniquity in high places.
Psalm 73:9	They have set their mouth against heaven, and their tongue has traversed the earth.
Psalm 73:10	Therefore, my people will be converted here, and fullness of days will be found in them.
Psalm 73:11	And they said, “How would God know?” and, “Isn’t there knowledge in high places?”
Psalm 73:12	Behold, these are sinners, and, abounding in this age, they have obtained riches.
Psalm 73:13	And I said: So then, it is without purpose that I have justified my heart and washed my hands among the innocent.
Psalm 73:14	And I have been scourged all day long, and I have received my chastisement in the mornings.
Psalm 73:15	If I were to say that I would explain this: Behold, I would condemn this nation of your sons.
Psalm 73:16	I considered, so that I might know this. It is a hardship before me,
Psalm 73:17	until I may enter into the Sanctuary of God, and understand it to its last part.
Psalm 73:18	So, because of deceitfulness, truly, you have placed it before them. While they were being lifted up, you were casting them down.
Psalm 73:19	How have they been brought to desolation? They have suddenly failed. They have perished because of their iniquity.
Psalm 73:20	As a dream is to those who awaken, O Lord, so will you reduce their image to nothing in your city.
Psalm 73:21	For my heart has been inflamed, and my temperament has been changed.
Psalm 73:22	And so, I have been reduced to nothing, and I did not know it.
Psalm 73:23	I have become like a beast of burden to you, and I am always with you.
Psalm 73:24	You have held my right hand. And in your will, you have conducted me, and with your glory, you have taken me up.

Psalm 73:26	My body has failed, and my heart: O God of my heart, and God my portion, into eternity.
Psalm 73:27	For behold, those who put themselves far from you will perish. You have perished all those who fornicate away from you.

Psalm 74:1	The understanding of Asaph. O God, why have you rejected us to the end. Why has your fury become enraged over the sheep of your pasture?
Psalm 74:2	Be mindful of your congregation, which you have possessed from the beginning. You redeemed the scepter of your inheritance, mount Zion, in which you have dwelt.
Psalm 74:3	Lift up your hands against their arrogance in the end. How great the malice of the enemy has been in the sanctuary!
Psalm 74:4	And those who hate you have been glorified, in the midst of your solemnity. They have set up their own signs as a proof,
Psalm 74:5	as if it had been issued from on high; yet they did not understand. As in a forest of chopped wood,
Psalm 74:6	they have cut down the entrances themselves. With axe and hatchet, they have brought it down.
Psalm 74:7	They have set fire to your Sanctuary. They have polluted the tabernacle of your name on earth.
Psalm 74:8	They have said in their heart, the whole group of them together: “Let us cause all the feast days of God to cease from the land.
Psalm 74:9	We have not seen our proof; there is now no prophet. And he will no longer know us.”
Psalm 74:10	How long, O God, will the enemy place blame? Is the adversary to provoke your name until the end?
Psalm 74:11	Why do you turn your hand away, even your right hand, from the midst of your sinews, until the end?
Psalm 74:12	But God is our king before all ages. He has wrought salvation in the midst of the earth.
Psalm 74:13	In your virtue, you confirmed the sea. You crushed the heads of the serpents in the waters.
Psalm 74:14	You have broken the heads of the serpent. You have given him as food for the people of the Ethiopians.
Psalm 74:15	You have disrupted the fountains and the torrents. You have dried up the rivers of Ethan.
Psalm 74:16	Yours is the day, and yours is the night. You have made the morning light and the sun.
Psalm 74:17	You have made all the limits of the earth. The summer and the spring were formed by you.
Psalm 74:18	Be mindful of this: the enemy placed blame against the Lord, and a foolish people has incited against your name.
Psalm 74:19	Do not hand over to beasts the souls that confess to you; and do not forget the souls of your poor until the end.
Psalm 74:20	Consider your covenant. For those who have been darkened upon the earth have been filled by the iniquity of the houses.
Psalm 74:21	Do not allow the humble to be turned away in confusion. The poor and the needy will praise your name.
Psalm 74:22	Rise up, O God, judge your own case. Call to mind the accusations against you, which are made by the foolish all day long.
Psalm 74:23	Do not forget the voices of your adversaries. The arrogance of those who hate you rises up continually.
Psalm 75:1	Unto the end. May you not be corrupted. A Canticle Psalm of Asaph. We will confess to you, O God. We will confess, and we will call upon your name. We will describe your wonders.
Psalm 75:2	While I have time, I will judge justices.
Psalm 75:3	The earth has been dissolved, with all who dwell in it. I have confirmed its pillars.
Psalm 75:4	I said to the iniquitous: “Do not act unjustly,” and to the offenders: “Do not exalt the horn.”
Psalm 75:5	Do not exalt your horn on high. Do not speak iniquity against God.
Psalm 75:6	For it is neither from the east, nor from the west, nor before the desert mountains.
Psalm 75:7	For God is judge. This one he humbles and that one he exalts.
Psalm 75:8	For, in the hand of the Lord, there is a cup of undiluted wine, full of consternation. And he has tipped it from here to there. So, truly, its dregs have not been emptied. All the sinners of the earth will drink.
Psalm 75:9	But I will announce it in every age. I will sing to the God of Jacob.
Psalm 75:10	And I will break all the horns of sinners. And the horns of the just will be exalted.
Psalm 76:1	Unto the end. With Praises. A Psalm of Asaph. A Canticle to the Assyrians. In Judea, God is known. In Israel, his name is great.
Psalm 76:2	And his place has been formed with peace. And his dwelling place is in Zion.
Psalm 76:3	In that place, he has broken the powers of the bows, the shield, the sword, and the battle.
Psalm 76:4	You illuminate wondrously from the mountains of eternity.
Psalm 76:5	All the foolish of heart have been disturbed. They have slept their sleep, and all the men of riches have found nothing in their hands.
Psalm 76:6	At your rebuke, O God of Jacob, those who were mounted on horseback have fallen asleep.
Psalm 76:7	You are terrible, and so, who can withstand you? From thence is your wrath.
Psalm 76:8	You have caused judgment to be heard from heaven. The earth trembled and was quieted,
Psalm 76:9	when God rose up in judgment in order to bring salvation to all the meek of the earth.
Psalm 76:10	For the thinking of man will confess to you, and the legacy of his thinking will keep a feast day to you.
Psalm 76:11	Make vows and pay them to the Lord, your God. All you who surround him bring gifts: to him who is terrible,
Psalm 76:12	even to him who takes away the spirit of leaders, to him who is terrible with the kings of the earth.
Psalm 77:1	Unto the end. For Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph. I cried out to the Lord with my voice, to God with my voice, and he attended to me.
Psalm 77:2	In the days of my tribulation, I sought God, with my hands opposite him in the night, and I was not deceived. My soul refused to be consoled.
Psalm 77:3	I was mindful of God, and I was delighted, and I was distressed, and my spirit fell away.
Psalm 77:4	My eyes anticipated the vigils. I was disturbed, and I did not speak.
Psalm 77:5	I considered the days of antiquity, and I held the years of eternity in my mind.
Psalm 77:6	And I meditated in the night with my heart, and I was distressed, and I examined my spirit.
Psalm 77:7	So then, will God reject for eternity? Will he not continue to allow himself to show favor?
Psalm 77:8	Or, will he cut off his mercy in the end, from generation to generation?
Psalm 77:9	And would God ever forget to be merciful? Or, would he, in his wrath, restrict his mercies?
Psalm 77:10	And I said, “Now I have begun. This change is from the right hand of the Most High.”
Psalm 77:11	I was mindful of the works of the Lord. For I will be mindful from the beginning of your wonders,
Psalm 77:12	and I will meditate on all your works. And I will take part in your intentions.
Psalm 77:13	Your way, O God, is in what is holy. Which God is great like our God?
Psalm 77:14	You are the God who performs miracles. You have made your virtue known among the peoples.
Psalm 77:15	With your arm, you have redeemed your people, the sons of Jacob and of Joseph.
Psalm 77:16	The waters saw you, O God, the waters saw you, and they were afraid, and the depths were stirred up.
Psalm 77:17	Great was the sound of the waters. The clouds uttered a voice. For your arrows also pass by.
Psalm 77:18	The voice of your thunder is like a wheel. Your flashes have illuminated the whole world. The earth has quaked and trembled.
Psalm 77:19	Your way is through the sea, and your paths are through many waters. And your traces will not be known.
Psalm 77:20	You have conducted your people like sheep, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
Psalm 78:1	The understanding of Asaph. O my people, attend to my law. Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
Psalm 78:2	I will open my mouth in parables. I will speak about concepts that are from the beginning.
Psalm 78:3	We have heard and known such great things, as our fathers have described to us.
Psalm 78:4	These things have not been hidden from their sons in any generation: declaring the praises of the Lord, and his virtues, and the wonders that he has done.
Psalm 78:5	And he has received testimony with Jacob, and he has set a law within Israel. Such great things, he has commanded our fathers, so as to make these things known to their sons,
Psalm 78:6	so that another generation might know them, and so that the sons, who will be born and who will grow up, shall describe them to their sons.
Psalm 78:7	So then, may they put their hope in God, and may they not forget the works of God, and may they seek his commandments.
Psalm 78:8	May they not become like their fathers, a perverse and exasperating generation: a generation that does not straighten their heart and whose spirit is not trustworthy with God.
Psalm 78:9	The sons of Ephraim, who bend and shoot the bow, have been turned back in the day of battle.
Psalm 78:10	They have not kept the covenant of God. And they were not willing to walk in his law.
Psalm 78:11	And they have been forgetful of his benefits, and of his miracle, which he revealed to them.
Psalm 78:12	He performed miracles in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Tanis.
Psalm 78:13	He broke the sea and he led them through. And he stationed the waters, as if in a vessel.
Psalm 78:14	And he led them with a cloud by day, and with illumination by fire throughout the night.
Psalm 78:15	He broke through the rock in the wasteland, and he gave them to drink, as if from the great abyss.
Psalm 78:16	He brought forth water from the rock, and he conducted the waters, as if they were rivers.
Psalm 78:17	And yet, they continued to sin against him. In a waterless place, they provoked the Most High with resentment.
Psalm 78:18	And they tempted God in their hearts, by asking for food according to their desires.
Psalm 78:19	And they spoke badly about God. They said, “Would God be able to prepare a table in the desert?
Psalm 78:20	He struck the rock, and so waters flowed and the torrents flooded, but would even he be able to provide bread, or provide a table, for his people?”
Psalm 78:21	Therefore, the Lord heard, and he was dismayed, and a fire was kindled within Jacob, and an anger ascended into Israel.
Psalm 78:22	For they neither put their trust in God, nor did they hope in his salvation.
Psalm 78:23	And he commanded the clouds from above, and he opened the doors of heaven.
Psalm 78:24	And he rained down manna upon them to eat, and he gave them the bread of heaven.

Psalm 78:26	He transferred the south wind from heaven, and, in his virtue, he brought in the Southwest wind.
Psalm 78:27	And he rained down flesh upon them, as if it were dust, and feathered birds, as if they were the sand of the sea.
Psalm 78:28	And they fell down in the midst of their camp, encircling their tabernacles.
Psalm 78:29	And they ate until they were greatly satisfied, and he brought to them according to their desires.
Psalm 78:30	They were not cheated out of what they wanted. Their food was still in their mouth,
Psalm 78:31	and then the wrath of God came upon them. And he slew the fat ones among them, and he impeded the elect of Israel.
Psalm 78:32	In all these things, they continued to sin, and they were not trustworthy with his miracles.
Psalm 78:33	And their days faded away into vanity, and their years with haste.
Psalm 78:34	When he slew them, then they sought him. And they returned, and they drew near to him in the early morning.
Psalm 78:35	And they were mindful that God is their helper and that the Most High God is their redeemer.
Psalm 78:36	And they chose him with their mouth, and then they lied to him with their tongue.
Psalm 78:37	For their heart was not upright with him, nor have they been living faithfully in his covenant.
Psalm 78:38	Yet he is merciful, and he will pardon their sins. And he will not destroy them. And he has abundantly turned aside his own wrath. And he did not enflame his wrath entirely.
Psalm 78:39	And he remembered that they are flesh: with a spirit that goes forth and does not return.
Psalm 78:40	How often did they provoke him in the desert and stir him to wrath in a waterless place?
Psalm 78:41	And they turned back and tempted God, and they exasperated the Holy One of Israel.

Psalm 78:47	And he slew their vineyards with hail and their mulberry trees with severe frost.
Psalm 78:48	And he delivered their cattle to the hail and their possessions to fire.
Psalm 78:49	And he sent the wrath of his indignation among them: indignation and wrath and tribulation, sent forth by evil angels.
Psalm 78:50	He made way for the path of his anger. He did not spare their souls from death. And he enclosed their beasts of burden in death.
Psalm 78:51	And he struck all the first-born in the land of Egypt: the first-fruits of all their labor in the tabernacles of Ham.
Psalm 78:52	And he took away his own people like sheep, and he led them through the wilderness like a flock.
Psalm 78:53	And he led them out in hope, and they did not fear. And the sea covered their enemies.
Psalm 78:54	And he led them to the mountain of his sanctification: the mountain that his right hand had acquired. And he cast out the Gentiles before their face. And he divided their land by lot to them, with a line of distribution.
Psalm 78:55	And he caused the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tabernacles.
Psalm 78:56	Yet they tempted and aggravated God Most High, and they did not keep his testaments.
Psalm 78:57	And they turned themselves aside, and they did not serve the covenant. In the same manner as their fathers, they were turned backwards, like a crooked bow.
Psalm 78:58	They impelled him to anger on their hills, and they provoked him to rivalry with their graven images.
Psalm 78:59	God listened, and he spurned them, and he reduced Israel greatly, almost to nothing.
Psalm 78:60	And he rejected the tabernacle of Shiloh, his tabernacle where he had dwelt among men.
Psalm 78:61	And he delivered their virtue into captivity, and their beauty into the hands of the enemy.
Psalm 78:62	And he enclosed his people with the sword, and he spurned his inheritance.
Psalm 78:63	Fire consumed their young men, and their virgins were not lamented.
Psalm 78:64	Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows did not weep.
Psalm 78:65	And the Lord was awaked, as if out of sleep, and like a powerful man impaired by wine.
Psalm 78:66	And he struck his enemies on the back. He gave them over to everlasting disgrace.
Psalm 78:67	And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph, and he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim.
Psalm 78:68	But he chose the tribe of Judah: mount Zion, which he loved.
Psalm 78:69	And he built up his sanctuary, like a single-horned beast, in the land that he founded for all ages.
Psalm 78:70	And he chose his servant David, and he took him from the flocks of the sheep: he received him from following the ewes with their young,
Psalm 78:71	in order to pasture Jacob his servant and Israel his inheritance.
Psalm 78:72	And he fed them with the innocence of his heart. And he led them with the understanding of his hands.
Psalm 79:1	A Psalm of Asaph. O God, the Gentiles have entered into your inheritance; they have polluted your holy temple. They have set Jerusalem as a place to tend fruit trees.
Psalm 79:2	They have placed the dead bodies of your servants as food for the birds of the sky, the flesh of your saints for the beasts of the earth.
Psalm 79:3	They have poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there was no one who would bury them.
Psalm 79:4	We have become a disgrace to our neighbors, an object of ridicule and mockery to those who are around us.
Psalm 79:5	How long, O Lord? Will you be angry until the end? Will your zeal be kindled like a fire?
Psalm 79:6	Pour out your wrath among the Gentiles, who have not known you, and upon the kingdoms that have not invoked your name.
Psalm 79:7	For they have devoured Jacob, and they have desolated his place.
Psalm 79:8	Do not remember our iniquities of the past. May your mercies quickly intercept us, for we have become exceedingly poor.
Psalm 79:9	Help us, O God, our Savior. And free us, Lord, for the glory of your name. And forgive us our sins for the sake of your name.
Psalm 79:10	Let them not say among the Gentiles, “Where is their God?” And may your name become known among the nations before our eyes. For the retribution of your servants’ blood, which has been poured out:
Psalm 79:11	may the groans of the shackled enter before you. According to the greatness of your arm, take possession of the sons of those who have been killed.
Psalm 79:12	And repay our neighbors sevenfold within their sinews. It is the reproach of the same ones who brought reproach against you, O Lord.
Psalm 79:13	But we are your people and the sheep of your pasture: we will give thanks to you in all ages. From generation to generation, we will announce your praise.
Psalm 80:1	Unto the end. For those who will be changed. The testimony of Asaph. A Psalm. The One who reigns over Israel: Be attentive. For you lead Joseph like a sheep. The One who sits upon the cherubim: Shine forth
Psalm 80:2	in the presence of Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh. Awaken your power and draw near, so as to accomplish our salvation.
Psalm 80:3	Convert us, O God. And reveal your face, and we will be saved.
Psalm 80:4	O Lord, God of hosts, how long will you be angry over the prayer of your servant?

Psalm 80:7	O God of hosts, convert us. And reveal your face, and we will be saved.
Psalm 80:8	You have transferred a vineyard from Egypt. You have cast out the Gentiles, and planted it.
Psalm 80:9	You were the leader of the journey in its sight. You planted its roots, and it filled the earth.
Psalm 80:10	Its shadow covered the hills, and its branches covered the cedars of God.
Psalm 80:11	It extended its new branches even to the sea, and its new seedlings even to the river.
Psalm 80:12	So then, why have you destroyed its walls, so that all those who pass by the way gather its grapes?
Psalm 80:13	The wild boar of the forest has trampled it, and a single wild beast has laid waste to it.
Psalm 80:14	Turn back, O God of hosts. Look down from heaven, and see, and visit this vineyard;
Psalm 80:15	and complete what your right hand has planted, and look upon the son of man, whom you have confirmed for yourself.
Psalm 80:16	Whatever has been set on fire and dug under will perish at the rebuke of your countenance.
Psalm 80:17	Let your hand be over the man on your right, and over the son of man, whom you have confirmed for yourself.
Psalm 80:18	For we do not depart from you, and you will revive us. And we will invoke your name.
Psalm 80:19	O Lord, God of hosts, convert us. And reveal your face, and we will be saved.

Psalm 81:2	Take up a psalm, and bring forth the timbrel: a pleasing Psalter with stringed instruments.

Psalm 81:5	He set it as a testimony with Joseph, when he went out of the land of Egypt. He heard a tongue that he did not know.
Psalm 81:6	He turned the burdens away from his back. His hands had been a slave to baskets.
Psalm 81:7	You called upon me in tribulation, and I freed you. I heard you within the hidden tempest. I tested you with waters of contradiction.
Psalm 81:8	My people, listen and I will call you to testify. If, O Israel, you will pay heed to me,
Psalm 81:9	then there will be no new god among you, nor will you adore a foreign god.
Psalm 81:10	For I am the Lord your God, who led you out of the land of Egypt. Widen your mouth, and I will fill it.
Psalm 81:11	But my people did not hear my voice, and Israel was not attentive to me.
Psalm 81:12	And so, I sent them away, according to the desires of their heart. They will go forth according to their own inventions.
Psalm 81:13	If my people had heard me, if Israel had walked in my ways,
Psalm 81:14	I would have humbled their enemies, as if it were nothing, and I would have sent my hand upon those who troubled them.

Psalm 83:3	They have acted with malice in counsel over your people, and they have plotted against your holy ones.
Psalm 83:4	They have said, “Come, let us scatter them from the nations and not allow the name of Israel to be remembered any longer.”
Psalm 83:5	For they plotted unanimously. Joined together against you, they ordained a covenant:
Psalm 83:6	the tabernacle of Edomites and Ishmaelites, and Moab and the Hagarites,
Psalm 83:7	and Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek, the foreigners among the inhabitants of Tyre.

Psalm 83:18	And let them know that the Lord is your name. You alone are the Most High in all the earth.
Psalm 84:1	Unto the end. For the wine and oil presses. A Psalm to the sons of Korah. How beloved are your tabernacles, O Lord of hosts!
Psalm 84:2	My soul longs and faints for the courts of the Lord. My heart and my flesh have exulted in the living God.

Psalm 85:4	Convert us, O God, our Savior, and turn your anger away from us.
Psalm 85:5	Will you be angry with us forever? And will you extend your wrath from generation to generation?

Psalm 85:8	I will listen to what the Lord God may be saying to me. For he will speak peace to his people, and to his saints, and to those who are being converted to the heart.

Psalm 87:3	Glorious things are being said of you, O City of God.

Psalm 88:1	A Canticle Psalm to the sons of Korah. Unto the end. For Mahalath, to answer the understanding of Heman the Ezrahite. O Lord, God of my salvation: I have cried out, day and night, in your presence.
Psalm 88:2	Let my prayer enter in your sight. Incline your ear to my petition.
Psalm 88:3	For my soul has been filled with evils, and my life has drawn near to Hell.
Psalm 88:4	I am considered to be among those who will descend into the pit. I have become like a man without assistance,
Psalm 88:5	idle among the dead. I am like the wounded sleeping in sepulchers, whom you no longer remember, and who have been repelled by your hand.

Psalm 88:7	Your fury has been confirmed over me. And you have brought all your waves upon me.

Psalm 88:10	Will you perform wonders for the dead? Or will physicians raise to life, and so confess to you?

Psalm 88:13	And I have cried out to you, O Lord, and in early morning, my prayer will come before you.
Psalm 88:14	Lord, why do you reject my prayer? Why do you turn your face away from me?
Psalm 88:15	I am poor, and I have been amid hardships from my youth. And, though I have been exalted, I am humbled and disturbed.
Psalm 88:16	Your wrath has crossed into me, and your terrors have disturbed me.
Psalm 88:17	They have surrounded me like water, all day long. They have surrounded me, all at once.
Psalm 88:18	Friend and neighbor, and my acquaintances, you have sent far away from me, away from misery.
Psalm 89:1	The understanding of Ethan the Ezrahite. I will sing the mercies of the Lord in eternity. I will announce your truth with my mouth, from generation to generation.

Psalm 89:3	I have set up a covenant with my elect. I have sworn to David my servant:
Psalm 89:4	I will prepare your offspring, even in eternity. And I will build up your throne, from generation to generation.
Psalm 89:5	The heavens will confess your miracles, Lord, and also your truth, in the Church of the saints.

Psalm 89:14	Justice and judgment are the preparation of your throne. Mercy and truth will precede your face.
Psalm 89:15	Blessed is the people that knows jubilation. They will walk in the light of your countenance, O Lord,
Psalm 89:16	and they will exult in your name all day long, and they will be exalted in your justice.
Psalm 89:17	For you are the glory of their virtue, and in your goodness, our horn will be exalted.
Psalm 89:18	For our assumption is of the Lord, and it is of our king, the holy one of Israel.
Psalm 89:19	Then you spoke in a vision to your holy ones, and you said: I have stationed help with the powerful one, and I have exalted the elect one from my people.
Psalm 89:20	I have found my servant David. I have anointed him with my holy oil.
Psalm 89:21	For my hand will assist him, and my arm will fortify him.
Psalm 89:22	The enemy will have no advantage over him, nor will the son of iniquity be positioned to harm him.
Psalm 89:23	And I will cut down his enemies before his face. And those who hate him, I will turn to flight.
Psalm 89:24	And my truth and my mercy will be with him. And his horn will be exalted in my name.
Psalm 89:25	And I will place his hand on the sea and his right hand on the rivers.
Psalm 89:26	He will invoke me: “You are my father, my God, and the support of my salvation.”
Psalm 89:27	And I will make him the first-born, preeminent before the kings of the earth.
Psalm 89:28	I will preserve my mercy for him eternally, and my covenant for him faithfully.
Psalm 89:29	And I will set his offspring from generation to generation, and his throne like the days of heaven.
Psalm 89:30	But if his sons abandon my law, and if they do not walk in my judgments,
Psalm 89:31	if they profane my justices, and if they do not keep my commandments:
Psalm 89:32	I will visit their iniquities with a rod, and their sins with a beating.
Psalm 89:33	But I will not scatter my mercy from him, and I will not do harm to my truth.
Psalm 89:34	And I will not profane my covenant, and I will not make void that which proceeds from my lips.
Psalm 89:35	I have sworn by my holiness one time: I will not lie to David,
Psalm 89:36	his offspring will remain for eternity. And his throne will be like the sun in my sight,
Psalm 89:37	and, like the moon, it is perfected in eternity, and it is a faithful witness in heaven.
Psalm 89:38	Yet, truly, you have rejected and despised, you have pushed away, my Christ.
Psalm 89:39	You have overthrown the covenant of your servant. You have profaned his sanctuary on earth.
Psalm 89:40	You have destroyed all his fences. You have made his territory dreadful.
Psalm 89:41	All who pass by the way have plundered him. He has become a disgrace to his neighbors.
Psalm 89:42	You have exalted the right hand of those who oppress him. You have brought joy to all his enemies.
Psalm 89:43	You have diverted the help of his sword, and you have not assisted him in battle.
Psalm 89:44	You have torn him away from cleansing, and you have smashed his throne down to the ground.
Psalm 89:45	You have reduced the days of his time. You have flooded him with confusion.
Psalm 89:46	How long, O Lord? Will you turn away unto the end? Will your wrath flare up like a fire?
Psalm 89:47	Remember what my substance is. For could you really have appointed all the sons of men in vain?
Psalm 89:48	Who is the man that will live, and yet not see death? Who will rescue his own soul from the hand of the underworld?
Psalm 89:49	O Lord, where are your mercies of antiquity, just as you swore to David in your truth?
Psalm 89:50	Be mindful, O Lord, of the disgrace of your servants (which I have sustained in my sinews) among many nations.
Psalm 89:51	With these, your enemies have reproached you, O Lord; with these, they have reproached the commutation of your Christ.
Psalm 89:52	Blessed is the Lord for all eternity. Amen. Amen.
Psalm 90:1	A prayer of Moses, the man of God. O Lord, you have been our refuge from generation to generation.
Psalm 90:2	Before the mountains became, or the land was formed along with the world: from ages past, even to all ages, you are God.
Psalm 90:3	And, lest man be turned aside in humiliation, you have said: Be converted, O sons of men.
Psalm 90:4	For a thousand years before your eyes are like the days of yesterday, which have passed by, and they are like a watch of the night,
Psalm 90:5	which was held for nothing: so their years shall be.
Psalm 90:6	In the morning, he may pass away like grass; in the morning, he may flower and pass away. In the evening, he will fall, and harden, and become dry.
Psalm 90:7	For, at your wrath, we have withered away, and we have been disturbed by your fury.
Psalm 90:8	You have placed our iniquities in your sight, our age in the illumination of your countenance.
Psalm 90:9	For all our days have faded away, and at your wrath, we have fainted. Our years will be considered to be like a spider’s web.
Psalm 90:10	The days of our years in them are seventy years. But in the powerful, they are eighty years, and more of these are with hardship and sorrow. For mildness has overwhelmed us, and we shall be corrected.
