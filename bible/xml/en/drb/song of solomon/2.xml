  <verse number="1">I am the flower of the field, and the lily of the valleys.</verse>
  <verse number="2">As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.</verse>
  <verse number="3">As the apple tree among the trees of the woods, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow, whom I desired: and his fruit was sweet to my palate.</verse>
  <verse number="4">He brought me into the cellar of wine, he set in order charity in me.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Stay me up with flowers, compass me about with apples: because I languish with love.</verse>
  <verse number="6">His left hand is under my head, and his right hand shall embrace me.</verse>
  <verse number="7">I adjure you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and the harts of the, fields, that you stir not up, nor make the beloved to awake, till she please.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The voice of my beloved, behold he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping over the hills.</verse>
  <verse number="9">My beloved is like a roe, or a young hart. Behold he standeth behind our wall, looking through the windows, looking through the lattices.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Behold my beloved speaketh to me: Arise, make haste, my love, my dove, my beautiful one, and come.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For winter is now past, the rain is over and gone.</verse>
  <verse number="12">The flowers have appeared in our land, the time of pruning is come: the voice of the turtle is heard in our land:</verse>
  <verse number="13">The fig tree hath put forth her green figs: the vines in flower yield their sweet smell. Arise, my love, my beautiful one, and come:</verse>
  <verse number="14">My dove in the clefts of the rock, in the hollow places of the wall, shew me thy face, let thy voice sound in my ears: for thy voice is sweet, and thy face comely.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Catch us the little foxes that destroy the vines: for our vineyard hath flourished.</verse>
  <verse number="16">My beloved to me, and I to him who feedeth among the lilies,</verse>
  <verse number="17">Till the day break, and the shadows retire. Return: be like, my beloved, to a roe, or to a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.</verse>
