<chapter book="Proverbs" number="6" translation="JPS Tanakh 1917 OT" translationID="jps" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">My son, if thou art become surety for thy neighbour, If thou hast struck thy hands for a stranger—</verse>
  <verse number="2">Thou art snared by the words of thy mouth, Thou art caught by the words of thy mouth—</verse>
  <verse number="3">Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, Seeing thou art come into the hand of thy neighbour; Go, humble thyself, and urge thy neighbour.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Deliver thyself as a gazelle from the hand [of the hunter], And as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Go to the ant, thou sluggard; Consider her ways, and be wise;</verse>
  <verse number="7">Which having no chief, Overseer, or ruler,</verse>
  <verse number="8">Provideth her bread in the summer, And gatherest her food in the harvest.</verse>
  <verse number="9">How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to sleep’—</verse>
  <verse number="11">So shall thy poverty come as a runner, And thy want as an armed man.</verse>
  <verse number="12">A base person, a man of iniquity, Is he that walketh with a froward mouth;</verse>
  <verse number="13">That winketh with his eyes, that scrapeth with his feet, That pointeth with his fingers;</verse>
  <verse number="14">Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth evil continually; He soweth discord.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; On a sudden shall he be broken, and that without remedy.</verse>
  <verse number="16">There are six things which the LORD hateth, Yea, seven which are an abomination unto Him:</verse>
  <verse number="17">Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, And hands that shed innocent blood;</verse>
  <verse number="18">A heart that deviseth wicked thoughts, Feet that are swift in running to evil;</verse>
  <verse number="19">A false witness that breatheth out lies, And he that soweth discord among brethren.</verse>
  <verse number="20">My son, keep the commandment of thy father, And forsake not the teaching of thy mother;</verse>
  <verse number="21">Bind them continually upon thy heart, Tie them about thy neck.</verse>
  <verse number="22">When thou walkest, it shall lead thee, When thou liest down, it shall watch over thee; And when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For the commandment is a lamp, and the teaching is light, And reproofs of instruction are the way of life;</verse>
  <verse number="24">To keep thee from the evil woman, From the smoothness of the alien tongue.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Lust not after her beauty in thy heart; Neither let her captivate thee with her eyelids.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For on account of a harlot a man is brought to a loaf of bread, But the adulteress hunteth for the precious life.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Can a man take fire in his bosom, And his clothes not be burned?</verse>
  <verse number="28">Or can one walk upon hot coals, And his feet not be scorched?</verse>
  <verse number="29">So he that goeth in to his neighbour’s wife; Whosoever toucheth her shall not go unpunished.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Men do not despise a thief, if he steal To satisfy his soul when he is hungry;</verse>
  <verse number="31">But if he be found, he must restore sevenfold, He must give all the substance of his house.</verse>
  <verse number="32">He that committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding; He doeth it that would destroy his own soul.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Wounds and dishonour shall he get, And his reproach shall not be wiped away.</verse>
  <verse number="34">For jealousy is the rage of a man, And he will not spare in the day of vengeance.</verse>
  <verse number="35">He will not regard any ransom; Neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.</verse>
