  <verse number="3">Prepare the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle!</verse>
  <verse number="4">Harness the horses, and get up, you horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets; furbish the spears, put on the coats of mail.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Why have I seen it? they are dismayed and are turned backward; and their mighty ones are beaten down, and have fled apace, and don’t look back: terror is on every side, says Yahweh.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Don’t let the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; in the north by the river Euphrates have they stumbled and fallen.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Who is this who rises up like the Nile, whose waters toss themselves like the rivers?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Egypt rises up like the Nile, and his waters toss themselves like the rivers: and he says, I will rise up, I will cover the earth; I will destroy cities and its inhabitants.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Go up, you horses; and rage, you chariots; and let the mighty men go forth: Cush and Put, who handle the shield; and the Ludim, who handle and bend the bow.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For that day is of the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall devour and be satiate, and shall drink its fill of their blood; for the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, has a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Go up into Gilead, and take balm, virgin daughter of Egypt: in vain do you use many medicines; there is no healing for you.</verse>
  <verse number="12">The nations have heard of your shame, and the earth is full of your cry; for the mighty man has stumbled against the mighty, they are fallen both of them together.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The word that Yahweh spoke to Jeremiah the prophet, how that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon should come and strike the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Declare in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Memphis and in Tahpanhes: say, Stand forth, and prepare; for the sword has devoured around you.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Why are your strong ones swept away? they didn’t stand, because Yahweh pushed them.</verse>
  <verse number="16">He made many to stumble, yes, they fell one on another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our birth, from the oppressing sword.</verse>
  <verse number="17">They cried there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he has let the appointed time pass by.</verse>
  <verse number="18">As I live, says the King, whose name is Yahweh of Armies, surely like Tabor among the mountains, and like Carmel by the sea, so shall he come.</verse>
  <verse number="19">You daughter who dwells in Egypt, furnish yourself to go into captivity; for Memphis shall become a desolation, and shall be burnt up, without inhabitant.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Egypt is a very beautiful heifer; but destruction out of the north has come, it has come.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Also her hired men in the midst of her are like calves of the stall; for they also are turned back, they are fled away together, they didn’t stand: for the day of their calamity has come on them, the time of their visitation.</verse>
  <verse number="22">The sound of it shall go like the serpent; for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as wood cutters.</verse>
  <verse number="23">They shall cut down her forest, says Yahweh, though it can’t be searched; because they are more than the locusts, and are innumerable.</verse>
  <verse number="24">The daughter of Egypt shall be disappointed; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: Behold, I will punish Amon of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with her gods, and her kings; even Pharaoh, and those who trust in him:</verse>
  <verse number="26">and I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants; and afterwards it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, says Yahweh.</verse>
  <verse number="27">But don’t you be afraid, Jacob my servant, neither be dismayed, Israel: for, behold, I will save you from afar, and your seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none shall make him afraid.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Don’t you be afraid, O Jacob my servant, says Yahweh; for I am with you: for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have driven you; but I will not make a full end of you, but I will correct you in measure, and will in no way leave you unpunished.</verse>
