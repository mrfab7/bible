<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was three score cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">That at what time you hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, you fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And whoever falls not down and worships shall the same hour be cast into the middle of a burning fiery furnace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Why at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">They spoke and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">You, O king, have made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And whoever falls not down and worships, that he should be cast into the middle of a burning fiery furnace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">There are certain Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have not regarded you: they serve not your gods, nor worship the golden image which you have set up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said to them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not you serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Now if you be ready that at what time you hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, you fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if you worship not, you shall be cast the same hour into the middle of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer you in this matter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods, nor worship the golden image which you have set up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: therefore he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the middle of the burning fiery furnace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flames of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the middle of the burning fiery furnace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste, and spoke, and said to his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the middle of the fire? They answered and said to the king, True, O king.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">He answered and said, See, I see four men loose, walking in the middle of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spoke, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, you servants of the most high God, come forth, and come here. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the middle of the fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king’s counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, on whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Then Nebuchadnezzar spoke, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king’s word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon.</p>
