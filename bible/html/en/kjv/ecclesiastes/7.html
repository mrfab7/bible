<div class="chapter" data-book="Ecclesiastes" data-chapter="7" data-translation="King James Bible" data-translation-id="kjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">A good name [is] better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of oneâ€™s birth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">[It is] better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that [is] the end of all men; and the living will lay [it] to his heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Sorrow [is] better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The heart of the wise [is] in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools [is] in the house of mirth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">[It is] better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so [is] the laughter of the fool: this also [is] vanity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Better [is] the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: [and] the patient in spirit [is] better than the proud in spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Say not thou, What is [the cause] that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Wisdom [is] good with an inheritance: and [by it there is] profit to them that see the sun.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For wisdom [is] a defence, [and] money [is] a defence: but the excellency of knowledge [is, that] wisdom giveth life to them that have it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Consider the work of God: for who can make [that] straight, which he hath made crooked?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">All [things] have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just [man] that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked [man] that prolongeth [his life] in his wickedness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">[It is] good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty [men] which are in the city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For [there is] not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it [was] far from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason [of things], and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness [and] madness:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart [is] snares and nets, [and] her hands [as] bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, [counting] one by one, to find out the account:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.</p>
