<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">In my Father’s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Thomas saith to him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Jesus saith to him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man cometh to the Father, but by me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">If ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Philip saith to him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Jesus saith to him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me Philip? he that hath seen me, hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Show us the Father?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak to you, I speak not from myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works’ sake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Verily, verily, I say to you, he that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go to my Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And whatever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">If ye love me, keep my commandments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And I will pray the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and will be in you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">I will not leave you comfortless; I will come to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me, shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Judas, not Iscariot, saith to him, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us, and not to the world?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Jesus answered and said to him, If a man loveth me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our abode with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He that loveth me not, keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but that of the Father who sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">These things have I spoken to you, being yet present with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">But the Comforter, who is the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatever I have said to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Peace I leave with you, my peace I give to you: not as the world giveth, give I to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Ye have heard that I said to you, I go away, and come again to you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go to the Father: for my Father is greater than I.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And now I have told you before it cometh to pass, that when it hath come to pass, ye may believe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.</p>
