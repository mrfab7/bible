<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Wo to them purposing vanity, and working evil upon their beds! In the light of the morning they will do it because it is to the strength of their hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And they desired fields, and they took by force; and houses, and they took away: and they oppressed a man and his house, and a man and his inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For this, thus said Jehovah: Behold me purposing evil against this family, which ye shall not remove your necks from thence; and ye shall not go loftily: for it is an evil time.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">In that day a parable shall be lifted up against you, and a wailing of a wailing was wailed, saying, Being laid waste, we shall be laid waste: he will exchange a portion of my people: how he will remove to me; for turning away, he will divide our fields.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For this there shall not be to thee any casting a cord by lot in the convocation of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Ye shall not let fall in drops; they shall let fall in drops; they shall not let fall in drops for these; shame shall not be removed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Causing the house of Jacob to say, Was the spirit of Jehovah shortened? if these his doings? shall not my words do good to a people going straight?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Aforetime my people for the enemy: he will raise them up from before the garment; ye will put off the wide cloak from those passing by with confidence, turning back the war.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The women of my people ye will thrust out from the house of her delights; from her children ye will take my majesty forever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Arise ye, and go, for this is not the rest: because it was defiled it will destroy, and with a sore destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">If a man going in the spirit and falsehood, lying, I will drop to thee for wine and for strong drink; and he was the dropping of this people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Gathering, O Jacob, I will gather all of thee; collecting, I will collect the remnant of Israel; together I will set them as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their pasture they shall make noise from man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He breaking forth came up before them: they broke forth and they will pass through the gate, they will go forth by it; and their king will pass through before them and Jehovah at their head.</p>
