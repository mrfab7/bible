<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I gave order to the churches of Galatia, so also do ye.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Upon the first day of the week let each one of you lay by him in store, as he may prosper, that no collections be made when I come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And when I arrive, whomsoever ye shall approve, them will I send with letters to carry your bounty unto Jerusalem:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">and if it be meet for me to go also, they shall go with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But I will come unto you, when I shall have passed through Macedonia; for I pass through Macedonia;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">but with you it may be that I shall abide, or even winter, that ye may set me forward on my journey whithersoever I go.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For I do not wish to see you now by the way; for I hope to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">for a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Now if Timothy come, see that he be with you without fear; for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">let no man therefore despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come unto me: for I expect him with the brethren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But as touching Apollos the brother, I besought him much to come unto you with the brethren: and it was not at all his will to come now; but he will come when he shall have opportunity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Let all that ye do be done in love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Now I beseech you, brethren (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to minister unto the saints),</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">that ye also be in subjection unto such, and to every one that helpeth in the work and laboreth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they supplied.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For they refreshed my spirit and yours: acknowledge ye therefore them that are such.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Prisca salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">All the brethren salute you. Salute one another with a holy kiss.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">If any man loveth not the Lord, let him be anathema. Maranatha.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.</p>
