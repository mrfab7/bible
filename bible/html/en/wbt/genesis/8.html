<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And God remembered Noah, and every living animal, and all the cattle that were with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters were checked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The fountains also of the deep, and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the waters decreased continually, till the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, till the waters were dried from off the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned to him into the ark; for the waters were on the face of the whole earth. Then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in to him into the ark.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And he stayed yet other seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And the dove came in to him in the evening, and lo, in her mouth was an olive-leaf plucked off: So Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And he stayed yet other seven days, and sent forth the dove; which returned not again to him any more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and behold, the face of the ground was dry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And God spoke to Noah, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Go forth from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons’ wives with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Bring forth with thee every living animal that is with thee, of all flesh, of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly on the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Every beast, every creeping animal, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went out of the ark.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And Noah built an altar to the LORD, and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt-offerings on the altar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And the LORD smelled a sweet savor; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake; for the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth: neither will I again smite any more every living animal as I have done.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">While the earth remaineth, seed-time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.</p>
