1	Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2	We return thanks to God always for you all, making remembrance of you in our prayers continually;
3	Remembering your work of faith, and fatigue of love, and patience of hope of our Lord Jesus Christ, before God and our Father;
4	Knowing, brethren beloved, of God your selection.
5	For our good news was not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much complete certainty; as we know what we were among you for your sake.
6	And ye were imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much pressure, with joy of the Holy Spirit:
7	So that ye were types to all believing in Macedonia and Achaia.
8	For from you sounded forth the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith towards God went out; so that we have no need to speak any thing.
9	For they themselves proclaim of us what entrance we have to you, and how ye turned to God from images to serve the living and true God;
10	And to wait for his Son from the heavens, whom be raised from the dead, Jesus, saving us from coming wrath.
