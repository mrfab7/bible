  <verse number="1">AND some coming down from Judea, taught the brethren: That except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses, you cannot be saved.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And when Paul and Barnabas had no small contest with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain others of the other side, should go up to the apostles and priests to Jerusalem about this question.</verse>
  <verse number="3">They therefore being brought on their way by the church, passed through Phenice, and Samaria, relating the conversion of the Gentiles; and they caused great joy to all the brethren.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received by the church, and by the apostles and ancients, declaring how great things God had done with them.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But there arose some of the sect of the Pharisees that believed, saying: They must be circumcised, and be commanded to observe the law of Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the apostles and ancients assembled to consider of this matter.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And when there had been much disputing, Peter, rising up, said to them: Men, brethren, you know, that in former days God made choice among us, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And God, who knoweth the hearts, gave testimony, giving unto them the Holy Ghost, as well as to us;</verse>
  <verse number="9">And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Now therefore, why tempt you God to put a yoke upon the necks of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?</verse>
  <verse number="11">But by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we believe to be saved, in like manner as they also.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And all the multitude held their peace; and they heard Barnabas and Paul telling what great signs and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying: Men, brethren, hear me.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Simon hath related how God first visited to take of the Gentiles a people to his name.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And to this agree the words of the prophets, as it is written:</verse>
  <verse number="16">After these things I will return, and will rebuild the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and the ruins thereof I will rebuild, and I will set it up:</verse>
  <verse number="17">That the residue of men may seek after the Lord, and all nations upon whom my name is invoked, saith the Lord, who doth these things.</verse>
  <verse number="18">To the Lord was his own work known from the beginning of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For which cause I judge that they, who from among the Gentiles are converted to God, are not to be disquieted.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But that we write unto them, that they refrain themselves from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him in the synagogues, where he is read every sabbath.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Then it pleased the apostles and ancients, with the whole church, to choose men of their own company, and to send to Antioch, with Paul and Barnabas, namely, Judas, who was surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Writing by their hands: The apostles and ancients, brethren, to the brethren of the Gentiles that are at Antioch, and in Syria and Cilicia, greeting.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Forasmuch as we have heard, that some going out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls; to whom we gave no commandment:</verse>
  <verse number="25">It hath seemed good to us, being assembled together, to choose out men, and to send them unto you, with our well beloved Barnabas and Paul:</verse>
  <verse number="26">Men that have given their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="27">We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves also will, by word of mouth, tell you the same things.</verse>
  <verse number="28">For it hath seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us, to lay no further burden upon you than these necessary things:</verse>
  <verse number="29">That you abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which things keeping yourselves, you shall do well. Fare ye well.</verse>
  <verse number="30">They therefore being dismissed, went down to Antioch; and gathering together the multitude, delivered the epistle.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.</verse>
  <verse number="32">But Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, with many words comforted the brethren, and confirmed them.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And after they had spent some time there, they were let go with peace by the brethren, unto them that had sent them.</verse>
  <verse number="34">But it seemed good unto Silas to remain there; and Judas alone departed to Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And Paul and Barnabas continued at Antioch, teaching and preaching, with many others, the word of the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And after some days, Paul said to Barnabas: Let us return and visit our brethren in all the cities wherein we have preached the word of the Lord, to see how they do.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And Barnabas would have taken with them John also, that was surnamed Mark;</verse>
  <verse number="38">But Paul desired that he (as having departed from them out of Pamphylia, and not gone with them to the work) might not be received.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And there arose a dissension, so that they departed one from another; and Barnabas indeed taking Mark, sailed to Cyprus.</verse>
  <verse number="40">But Paul choosing Silas, departed, being delivered by the brethren to the grace of God.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches, commanding them to keep the precepts of the apostles and the ancients.</verse>
