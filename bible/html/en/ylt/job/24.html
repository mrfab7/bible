<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Wherefore from the Mighty One Times have not been hidden, And those knowing Him have not seen His days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The borders they reach, A drove they have taken violently away, Yea, they do evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The ass of the fatherless they lead away, They take in pledge the ox of the widow,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">They turn aside the needy from the way, Together have hid the poor of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Lo, wild asses in a wilderness, They have gone out about their work, Seeking early for prey, A mixture for himself—food for young ones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">In a field his provender they reap, And the vineyard of the wicked they glean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The naked they cause to lodge Without clothing. And there is no covering in the cold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">From the inundation of hills they are wet, And without a refuge—have embraced a rock.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">They take violently away From the breast the orphan, And on the poor they lay a pledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Naked, they have gone without clothing, And hungry—have taken away a sheaf.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Between their walls they make oil, Wine-presses they have trodden, and thirst.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Because of enmity men do groan, And the soul of pierced ones doth cry, And God doth not give praise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They have been among rebellious ones of light, They have not discerned His ways, Nor abode in His paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">At the light doth the murderer rise, He doth slay the poor and needy, And in the night he is as a thief.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And the eye of an adulterer Hath observed the twilight, Saying, ‘No eye doth behold me.’ And he putteth the face in secret.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He hath dug in the darkness—houses; By day they shut themselves up, They have not known light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">When together, morning is to them death shade, When he discerneth the terrors of death shade.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Light he is on the face of the waters, Vilified is their portion in the earth, He turneth not the way of vineyards.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Drought—also heat—consume snow-waters, Sheol those who have sinned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Forget him doth the womb, Sweeten on him doth the worm, No more is he remembered, And broken as a tree is wickedness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Treating evil the barren who beareth not, And to the widow he doth no good,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And hath drawn the mighty by his power, He riseth, and none believeth in life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He giveth to him confidence, and he is supported, And his eyes are on their ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">High they were for a little, and they are not, And they have been brought low. As all others they are shut up, And as the head of an ear of corn cut off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And if not now, who doth prove me a liar, And doth make of nothing my word?</p>
