<p class="verse" data-verse="1">A name is chosen rather than much wealth, Than silver and than gold—good grace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Rich and poor have met together, The Maker of them all is Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The prudent hath seen the evil, and is hidden, And the simple have passed on, and are punished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The end of humility is the fear of Jehovah, Riches, and honour, and life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Thorns—snares are in the way of the perverse, Whoso is keeping his soul is far from them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Give instruction to a youth about his way, Even when he is old he turneth not from it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The rich over the poor ruleth, And a servant is the borrower to the lender.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Whoso is sowing perverseness reapeth sorrow, And the rod of his anger weareth out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The good of eye—he is blessed, For he hath given of his bread to the poor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Cast out a scorner—and contention goeth out, And strife and shame cease.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Whoso is loving cleanness of heart, Grace are his lips, a king is his friend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The eyes of Jehovah have kept knowledge, And He overthroweth the words of the treacherous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The slothful hath said, ‘A lion is without, In the midst of the broad places I am slain.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">A deep pit is the mouth of strange women, The abhorred of Jehovah falleth there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Folly is bound up in the heart of a youth, The rod of chastisement putteth it far from him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He is oppressing the poor to multiply to him, He is giving to the rich—only to want.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Incline thine ear, and hear words of the wise, And thy heart set to my knowledge,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For they are pleasant when thou dost keep them in thy heart, They are prepared together for thy lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">That thy trust may be in Jehovah, I caused thee to know to-day, even thou.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Have I not written to thee three times With counsels and knowledge?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">To cause thee to know the certainty of sayings of truth, To return sayings of truth to those sending thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Rob not the poor because he is poor, And bruise not the afflicted in the gate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For Jehovah pleadeth their cause, And hath spoiled the soul of their spoilers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Shew not thyself friendly with an angry man, And with a man of fury go not in,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Lest thou learn his paths, And have received a snare to thy soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Be not thou among those striking hands, Among sureties for burdens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">If thou hast nothing to pay, Why doth he take thy bed from under thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Remove not a border of olden times, That thy fathers have made.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Hast thou seen a man speedy in his business? Before kings he doth station himself, He stations not himself before obscure men!</p>
