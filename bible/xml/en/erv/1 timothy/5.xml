<chapter book="1 Timothy" number="5" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Rebuke not an elder, but exhort him as a father; the younger men as brethren:</verse>
  <verse number="2">the elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, in all purity.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Honour widows that are widows indeed.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But if any widow hath children or grandchildren, let them learn first to shew piety towards their own family, and to requite their parents: for this is acceptable in the sight of God.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, hath her hope set on God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But she that giveth herself to pleasure is dead while she liveth.</verse>
  <verse number="7">These things also command, that they may be without reproach.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But if any provideth not for his own, and specially his own household, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Let none be enrolled as a widow under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man,</verse>
  <verse number="10">well reported of for good works; if she hath brought up children, if she hath used hospitality to strangers, if she hath washed the saints’ feet, if she hath relieved the afflicted, if she hath diligently followed every good work.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But younger widows refuse: for when they have waxed wanton against Christ, they desire to marry;</verse>
  <verse number="12">having condemnation, because they have rejected their first faith.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And withal they learn also to be idle, going about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I desire therefore that the younger widows marry, bear children, rule the household, give none occasion to the adversary for reviling:</verse>
  <verse number="15">for already some are turned aside after Satan.</verse>
  <verse number="16">If any woman that believeth hath widows, let her relieve them, and let not the church be burdened; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially those who labour in the word and in teaching.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his hire.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Against an elder receive not an accusation, except at the mouth of two or three witnesses.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Them that sin reprove in the sight of all, that the rest also may be in fear.</verse>
  <verse number="21">I charge thee in the sight of God, and Christ Jesus, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Lay hands hastily on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins: keep thyself pure.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Be no longer a drinker of water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake and thine often infirmities.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Some men’s sins are evident, going before unto judgment; and some men also they follow after.</verse>
  <verse number="25">In like manner also there are good works that are evident; and such as are otherwise cannot be hid.</verse>
