<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The elder unto Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Beloved, I pray that in all things thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For I rejoiced greatly, when brethren came and bare witness unto thy truth, even as thou walkest in truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Greater joy have I none than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Beloved, thou doest a faithful work in whatsoever thou doest toward them that are brethren and strangers withal;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">who bare witness to thy love before the church: whom thou wilt do well to set forward on their journey worthily of God:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">because that for the sake of the Name they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">We therefore ought to welcome such, that we may be fellow-workers with the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">I wrote somewhat unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he doeth, prating against us with wicked words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and them that would he forbiddeth, and casteth them out of the church.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Beloved, imitate not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: he that doeth evil hath not seen God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Demetrius hath the witness of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, we also bear witness; and thou knowest that our witness is true.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">I had many things to write unto thee, but I am unwilling to write them to thee with ink and pen:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">but I hope shortly to see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be unto thee. The friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name.</p>
