<chapter book="Isaiah" number="35" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">They joy from the wilderness and dry place, And rejoice doth the desert, and flourish as the rose,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Flourishing it doth flourish, and rejoice, Yea, with joy and singing, The honour of Lebanon hath been given to it, The beauty of Carmel and Sharon, They—they see the honour of Jehovah, The majesty of our God.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Strengthen ye the feeble hands, Yea, the stumbling knees strengthen.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Say to the hastened of heart, ‘Be strong, Fear not, lo, your God; vengeance cometh, The recompence of God, He Himself doth come and save you.’</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then opened are eyes of the blind, And ears of the deaf are unstopped,</verse>
  <verse number="6">Then leap as a hart doth the lame, And sing doth the tongue of the dumb, For broken up in a wilderness have been waters, And streams in a desert.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the mirage hath become a pond, And the thirsty land fountains of waters, In the habitation of dragons, Its place of couching down, a court for reed and rush.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And a highway hath been there, and a way, And the ‘way of holiness’ is called to it, Not pass over it doth the unclean, And He Himself is by them, Whoso is going in the way—even fools err not.</verse>
  <verse number="9">No lion is there, yea, a destructive beast Ascendeth it not, it is not found there, And walked have the redeemed,</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the ransomed of Jehovah return, And have entered Zion with singing. And joy age-during on their head, Joy and gladness they attain, And fled away have sorrow and sighing!</verse>
