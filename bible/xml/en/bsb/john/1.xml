<chapter book="John" number="1" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</verse>
  <verse number="2">He was with God in the beginning.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Through Him all things were made, and without Him nothing was made that has been made.</verse>
  <verse number="4">In Him was life, and that life was the light of men.</verse>
  <verse number="5">The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.</verse>
  <verse number="6">There came a man who was sent from God. His name was John.</verse>
  <verse number="7">He came as a witness to testify about the Light, so that through him everyone might believe.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He himself was not the Light, but he came to testify about the Light.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The true Light, who gives light to everyone, was coming into the world.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He was in the world, and though the world was made through Him, the world did not recognize Him.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But to all who did receive Him, to those who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God—</verse>
  <verse number="13">children born not of blood, nor of the desire or will of man, but born of God.</verse>
  <verse number="14">The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us. We have seen His glory, the glory of the one and only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.</verse>
  <verse number="15">John testified concerning Him. He cried out, saying, “This is He of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me has surpassed me because He was before me.’”</verse>
  <verse number="16">From His fullness we have all received grace upon grace.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="18">No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is Himself God and is at the Father’s side, has made Him known.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And this was John’s testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him, “Who are you?”</verse>
  <verse number="20">He did not refuse to confess, but openly declared, “I am not the Christ.”</verse>
  <verse number="21">“Then who are you?” they inquired. “Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” He answered, “No.”</verse>
  <verse number="22">So they said to him, “Who are you? We need an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”</verse>
  <verse number="23">John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet: “I am a voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way for the Lord.’”</verse>
  <verse number="24">Then the Pharisees who had been sent</verse>
  <verse number="25">asked him, “Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?”</verse>
  <verse number="26">“I baptize with water,” John replied, “but among you stands One you do not know.</verse>
  <verse number="27">He is the One who comes after me, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.”</verse>
  <verse number="28">All this happened at Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</verse>
  <verse number="29">The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!</verse>
  <verse number="30">This is He of whom I said, ‘A man who comes after me has surpassed me because He was before me.’</verse>
  <verse number="31">I myself did not know Him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that He might be revealed to Israel.”</verse>
  <verse number="32">Then John testified, “I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and resting on Him.</verse>
  <verse number="33">I myself did not know Him, but the One who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘The man on whom you see the Spirit descend and rest is He who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’</verse>
  <verse number="34">I have seen and testified that this is the Son of God.”</verse>
  <verse number="35">The next day John was there again with two of his disciples.</verse>
  <verse number="36">When he saw Jesus walking by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!”</verse>
  <verse number="37">And when the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="38">Jesus turned and saw them following. “What do you want?” He asked. They said to Him, “Rabbi” (which means Teacher), “where are You staying?”</verse>
  <verse number="39">“Come and see,” He replied. So they went and saw where He was staying, and spent that day with Him. It was about the tenth hour.</verse>
  <verse number="40">Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, was one of the two who heard John’s testimony and followed Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="41">He first found his brother Simon and told him, “We have found the Messiah” (which is translated as Christ).</verse>
  <verse number="42">Andrew brought him to Jesus, who looked at him and said, “You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas” (which is translated as Peter).</verse>
  <verse number="43">The next day Jesus decided to set out for Galilee. Finding Philip, He told him, “Follow Me.”</verse>
  <verse number="44">Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the same town as Andrew and Peter.</verse>
  <verse number="45">Philip found Nathanael and told him, “We have found the One Moses wrote about in the Law, the One the prophets foretold—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”</verse>
  <verse number="46">“Can anything good come from Nazareth?” Nathanael asked. “Come and see,” said Philip.</verse>
  <verse number="47">When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, He said of him, “Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is no deceit.”</verse>
  <verse number="48">“How do You know me?” Nathanael asked. Jesus replied, “Before Philip called you, I saw you under the fig tree.”</verse>
  <verse number="49">“Rabbi,” Nathanael answered, “You are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!”</verse>
  <verse number="50">Jesus said to him, “Do you believe just because I told you I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than these.”</verse>
  <verse number="51">Then He declared, “Truly, truly, I tell you, you will all see heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”</verse>
