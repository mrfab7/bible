<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="6" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor, if you have struck hands in pledge with a stranger,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">if you have been trapped by the words of your lips, ensnared by the words of your mouth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">then do this, my son, to free yourself, for you have fallen into your neighbor’s hands: Go, humble yourself, and press your plea with your neighbor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Allow no sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the snare of the fowler.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Walk in the manner of the ant, O slacker; observe its ways and become wise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Without a commander, without an overseer or ruler,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">it prepares its provisions in summer; it gathers its food at harvest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">How long will you lie there, O slacker? When will you get up from your sleep?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and need like a bandit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">A worthless person, a wicked man, walks with a perverse mouth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">winking his eyes, speaking with his feet, and pointing with his fingers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">With deceit in his heart he devises evil; he continually sows discord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly; in an instant he will be shattered beyond recovery.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">There are six things that the LORD hates, seven that are detestable to Him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that run swiftly to evil,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">a false witness who gives false testimony, and one who stirs up discord among brothers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">My son, keep your father’s commandment, and do not forsake your mother’s teaching.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Bind them always upon your heart; tie them around your neck.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">When you walk, they will guide you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; when you awake, they will speak to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For this commandment is a lamp, this teaching is a light, and the reproofs of discipline are the way to life,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">to keep you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the adulteress.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Do not lust in your heart for her beauty or let her captivate you with her eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For the levy of the prostitute is poverty, and the adulteress preys upon your very life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Can a man embrace fire and his clothes not be burned?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Can a man walk on hot coals without scorching his feet?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">So is he who sleeps with another man’s wife; no one who touches her will go unpunished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Men do not despise the thief if he steals to satisfy his hunger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Yet if caught, he must pay sevenfold; he must give up all the wealth of his house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">He who commits adultery lacks judgment; whoever does so destroys himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Wounds and dishonor will befall him, and his reproach will never be wiped away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">For jealousy enrages a husband, and he will show no mercy in the day of vengeance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">He will not be appeased by any ransom, or persuaded by lavish gifts.</p>
