<chapter book="2 Kings" number="3" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, wherewith he made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster; and he rendered unto the king of Israel the wool of an hundred thousand lambs, and of an hundred thousand rams.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And king Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time, and mustered all Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way of the wilderness of Edom.</verse>
  <verse number="9">So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they made a circuit of seven days’ journey: and there was no water for the host, nor for the beasts that followed them.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the king of Israel said, Alas! for the LORD hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may inquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel’s servants answered and said, Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the LORD hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of trenches.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain, yet that valley shall be filled with water: and ye shall drink, both ye and your cattle and your beasts.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will also deliver the Moabites into your hand.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all fountains of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And it came to pass in the morning, about the time of offering the oblation, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Now when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood on the border.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water over against them as red as blood:</verse>
  <verse number="23">and they said, This is blood; the kings are surely destroyed, and they have smitten each man his fellow: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: and they went forward into the land smiting the Moabites.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And they beat down the cities; and on every good piece of land they cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the fountains of water, and felled all the good trees: until in Kir-hareseth only they left the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew sword, to break through unto the king of Edom: but they could not.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great wrath against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.</verse>
