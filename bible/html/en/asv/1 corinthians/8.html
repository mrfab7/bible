<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Corinthians" data-chapter="8" data-translation="American Standard Version" data-translation-id="asv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">If any man thinketh that he knoweth anything, he knoweth not yet as he ought to know;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">but if any man loveth God, the same is known by him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Concerning therefore the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no God but one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth; as there are gods many, and lords many;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Howbeit there is not in all men that knowledge: but some, being used until now to the idol, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But food will not commend us to God: neither, if we eat not, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to the weak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For if a man see thee who hast knowledge sitting at meat in an idolâ€™s temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For through thy knowledge he that is weak perisheth, the brother for whose sake Christ died.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And thus, sinning against the brethren, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, ye sin against Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Wherefore, if meat causeth my brother to stumble, I will eat no flesh for evermore, that I cause not my brother to stumble.</p>
