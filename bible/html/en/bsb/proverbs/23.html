<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="23" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">When you sit down to dine with a ruler, consider carefully what is set before you,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and put a knife to your throat if you possess a great appetite.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Do not crave his delicacies, for that food is deceptive.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Do not wear yourself out to get rich; be wise enough to restrain yourself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">When you glance at wealth, it disappears, for it makes wings for itself and flies like an eagle to the sky.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Do not eat the bread of a stingy man, and do not crave his delicacies;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">for he is keeping track, inwardly counting the cost. “Eat and drink,” he says to you, but his heart is not with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">You will vomit up what little you have eaten and waste your pleasant words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Do not speak to a fool, for he will despise the wisdom of your words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Do not move an ancient boundary stone or encroach on the fields of the fatherless,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">for their Redeemer is strong; He will take up their case against you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Apply your heart to instruction and your ears to words of knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Do not withhold discipline from a child; although you strike him with a rod, he will not die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Strike him with a rod, and you will deliver his soul from Sheol.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">My son, if your heart is wise, my own heart will indeed rejoice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">My inmost being will rejoice when your lips speak what is right.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Do not let your heart envy sinners, but always continue in the fear of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For surely there is a future, and your hope will not be cut off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Listen, my son, and be wise, and guide your heart on the right course.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Do not join those who drink too much wine or gorge themselves on meat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty, and drowsiness will clothe them in rags.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Listen to your father who gave you life, and do not despise your mother when she is old.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Invest in truth and never sell it—in wisdom and instruction and understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The father of a righteous man will greatly rejoice, and he who fathers a wise son will delight in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">May your father and mother be glad, and may she who gave you birth rejoice!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">My son, give me your heart, and let your eyes delight in my ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For a prostitute is a deep pit, and an adulteress is a narrow well.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Like a robber she lies in wait and multiplies the faithless among men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has contentions? Who has complaints? Who has needless wounds? Who has bloodshot eyes?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Those who linger over wine, who go to taste mixed drinks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Do not gaze at wine while it is red, when it sparkles in the cup and goes down smoothly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">In the end it bites like a snake and stings like a viper.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Your eyes will see strange things, and your mind will utter perversities.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">You will be like one sleeping on the high seas or lying on the top of a mast:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">“They struck me, but I feel no pain! They beat me, but I did not know it! When can I wake up to search for another drink?”</p>
