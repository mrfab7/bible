<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="5" data-translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" data-translation-id="drb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, attend to my wisdom, and incline thy ear to my prudence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">That thou mayst keep thoughts, and thy lips may preserve instruction. Mind not the deceit of a woman.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For the lips of a harlot are like a honeycomb dropping, and her throat is smoother than oil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But her end is bitter as wormwood, and sharp as a two-edged sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Her feet go down into death, and her steps go in as far as hell.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">They walk not by the path of life, her steps are wandering, and unaccountable.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Now therefore, my son, hear me, and depart not from the words of my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the doors of her house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Give not thy honour to strangers, and thy years to the cruel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Lest strangers be filled with thy strength, and thy labours be in another manâ€™s house,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And thou mourn it the last, when thou shalt have spent thy flesh and thy body, and say:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Why have I hated instruction, and my heart consented not to reproof,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And have not heard the voice of them that taught me, and have not in- dined my ear to masters?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I have almost been in all evil, in the midst of the church and of the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Drink water out of thy own cistern, and the streams of thy own well:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Let thy fountains be conveyed abroad, and in the streets divide thy waters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Keep them to thyself alone, neither let strangers be partakers with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Let thy vein be blessed, and rejoice with the wife of thy youth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Let her be thy dearest hind, and most agreeable fawn: let her breasts inebriate thee at all times; he thou delighted continually with her love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Why art thou seduced, my son, by a strange woman, and art cherished in the bosom of another ?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">The Lord beholdeth the ways of man, and considereth all his steps.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">His own iniquities catch the wicked, and he is fast bound with the ropes of his own sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He shall die, because he hath not received instruction, and in the multitude of his folly he shall be deceived.</p>
