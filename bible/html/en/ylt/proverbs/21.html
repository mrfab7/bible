<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Rivulets of waters is the heart of a king in the hand of Jehovah, Wherever He pleaseth He inclineth it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Every way of a man is right in his own eyes, And Jehovah is pondering hearts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">To do righteousness and judgment, Is chosen of Jehovah rather than sacrifice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Loftiness of eyes, and breadth of heart, Tillage of the wicked is sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The purposes of the diligent are only to advantage, And of every hasty one, only to want.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The making of treasures by a lying tongue, Is a vanity driven away of those seeking death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The spoil of the wicked catcheth them, Because they have refused to do judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Froward is the way of a man who is vile, And the pure—upright is his work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Better to sit on a corner of the roof, Than with a woman of contentions and a house of company.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The soul of the wicked hath desired evil, Not gracious in his eyes is his neighbour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">When the scorner is punished, the simple becometh wise, And in giving understanding to the wise He receiveth knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The Righteous One is acting wisely Towards the house of the wicked, He is overthrowing the wicked for wickedness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Whoso is shutting his ear from the cry of the poor, He also doth cry, and is not answered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">A gift in secret pacifieth anger, And a bribe in the bosom strong fury.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">To do justice is joy to the righteous, But ruin to workers of iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">A man who is wandering from the way of understanding, In an assembly of Rephaim resteth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Whoso is loving mirth is a poor man, Whoso is loving wine and oil maketh no wealth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The wicked is an atonement for the righteous, And for the upright the treacherous dealer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Better to dwell in a wilderness land, Than with a woman of contentions and anger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">A treasure to be desired, and oil, Is in the habitation of the wise, And a foolish man swalloweth it up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Whoso is pursuing righteousness and kindness, Findeth life, righteousness, and honour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">A city of the mighty hath the wise gone up, And bringeth down the strength of its confidence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Whoso is keeping his mouth and his tongue, Is keeping from adversities his soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Proud, haughty, scorner is his name, Who is working in the wrath of pride.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The desire of the slothful slayeth him, For his hands have refused to work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">All the day desiring he hath desired, And the righteous giveth and withholdeth not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination, Much more when in wickedness he bringeth it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">A false witness doth perish, And an attentive man for ever speaketh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">A wicked man hath hardened by his face, And the upright—he prepareth his way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">There is no wisdom, nor understanding, Nor counsel, over-against Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">A horse is prepared for a day of battle, And the deliverance is of Jehovah!</p>
