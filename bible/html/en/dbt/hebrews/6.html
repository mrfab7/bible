<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Wherefore, leaving the word of the beginning of the Christ, let us go on [to what belongs] to full growth, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and faith in God,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">of [the] doctrine of washings, and of imposition of hands, and of resurrection of [the] dead, and of eternal judgment;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and this will we do if God permit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For it is impossible to renew again to repentance those once enlightened, and who have tasted of the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of [the] Holy Spirit,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">and have tasted the good word of God, and [the] works of power of [the] age to come,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and have fallen away, crucifying for themselves [as they do] the Son of God, and making a show of [him].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For ground which drinks the rain which comes often upon it, and produces useful herbs for those for whose sakes also it is tilled, partakes of blessing from God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">but bringing forth thorns and briars, it is found worthless and nigh to a curse, whose end [is] to be burned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But we are persuaded concerning you, beloved, better things, and connected with salvation, even if we speak thus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For God [is] not unrighteous to forget your work, and the love which ye have shewn to his name, having ministered to the saints, and [still] ministering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">But we desire earnestly that each one of you shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">that ye be not sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience have been inheritors of the promises.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For God, having promised to Abraham, since he had no greater to swear by, swore by himself,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">and thus, having had long patience, he got the promise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For men indeed swear by a greater, and with them the oath is a term to all dispute, as making matters sure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Wherein God, willing to shew more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of his purpose, intervened by an oath,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">that by two unchangeable things, in which [it was] impossible that God should lie, we might have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">which we have as anchor of the soul, both secure and firm, and entering into that within the veil,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">where Jesus is entered as forerunner for us, become for ever a high priest according to the order of Melchisedec.</p>
