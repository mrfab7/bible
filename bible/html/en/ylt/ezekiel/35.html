<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">‘Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and thou hast said to it: Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Lo, I am against thee, O mount Seir, And have stretched out My hand against thee, And made thee a desolation and an astonishment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thy cities a waste I make, and thou art a desolation, And thou hast known that I am Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Because of thy having an enmity age-during, And thou dost saw the sons of Israel, By the hands of the sword, In the time of their calamity, In the time of the iniquity of the end:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Therefore, I live—an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah, Surely for blood I do appoint thee, And blood doth pursue thee, If blood thou hast not hated, Blood also doth pursue thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And I have given mount Seir for a desolation and an astonishment, And have cut off from it him who is passing over and him who is returning,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And filled his mountains with his wounded, Thy hills, and thy valleys, and all thy streams, The pierced of the sword fall into them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Desolations age-during I make thee, And thy cities do not return, And ye have known that I am Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Because of thy saying: The two nations and the two lands are mine, and we have possessed it, And Jehovah hath been there;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Therefore, I live—an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah, And I have done according to thine anger, And according to thine envy, With which thou hast wrought, Because of thy hatred against them, And I have been known among them when I judge thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And thou hast known that I—Jehovah, I have heard all thy despisings that thou hast spoken Against mountains of Israel, saying: A desolation, to us they were given for food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And ye magnify yourselves against Me with your mouth, And have made abundant against Me your words, I—I have heard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Thus said the Lord Jehovah: According to the rejoicing of the whole land, A desolation I make of thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">According to thy joy at the inheritance of the house of Israel because of desolation, So I do to thee—a desolation thou art, O mount Seir, and all Edom—all of it, And they have known that I am Jehovah!</p>
