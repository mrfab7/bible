<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Stand firm therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and don’t be entangled again with a yoke of bondage.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Behold, I, Paul, tell you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Yes, I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">You are alienated from Christ, you who desire to be justified by the law. You have fallen away from grace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For we, through the Spirit, by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision amounts to anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">You were running well! Who interfered with you that you should not obey the truth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">This persuasion is not from him who calls you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">A little yeast grows through the whole lump.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will think no other way. But he who troubles you will bear his judgment, whoever he is.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been removed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I wish that those who disturb you would cut themselves off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For you, brothers, were called for freedom. Only don’t use your freedom for gain to the flesh, but through love be servants to one another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But if you bite and devour one another, be careful that you don’t consume one another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you won’t fulfill the lust of the flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, that you may not do the things that you desire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Now the works of the flesh are obvious, which are: adultery, sexual immorality, uncleanness, lustfulness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousies, outbursts of anger, rivalries, divisions, heresies,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">envyings, murders, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these; of which I forewarn you, even as I also forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">If we live by the Spirit, let’s also walk by the Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Let’s not become conceited, provoking one another, and envying one another.</p>
