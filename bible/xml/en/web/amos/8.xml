<chapter book="Amos" number="8" translation="World English Bible" translationID="web" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Thus the Lord Yahweh showed me: behold, a basket of summer fruit.</verse>
  <verse number="2">He said, “Amos, what do you see?” I said, “A basket of summer fruit.” Then Yahweh said to me, “The end has come on my people Israel. I will not again pass by them any more.</verse>
  <verse number="3">The songs of the temple will be wailings in that day,” says the Lord Yahweh. “The dead bodies will be many. In every place they will throw them out with silence.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Hear this, you who desire to swallow up the needy, and cause the poor of the land to fail,</verse>
  <verse number="5">Saying, ‘When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell grain? And the Sabbath, that we may market wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel large, and dealing falsely with balances of deceit;</verse>
  <verse number="6">that we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes, and sell the sweepings with the wheat?’”</verse>
  <verse number="7">Yahweh has sworn by the pride of Jacob, “Surely I will never forget any of their works.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Won’t the land tremble for this, and everyone mourn who dwells in it? Yes, it will rise up wholly like the River; and it will be stirred up and sink again, like the River of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="9">It will happen in that day,” says the Lord Yahweh, “that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day.</verse>
  <verse number="10">I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will make you wear sackcloth on all your bodies, and baldness on every head. I will make it like the mourning for an only son, and its end like a bitter day.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Behold, the days come,” says the Lord Yahweh, “that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of Yahweh.</verse>
  <verse number="12">They will wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east; they will run back and forth to seek the word of Yahweh, and will not find it.</verse>
  <verse number="13">In that day the beautiful virgins and the young men will faint for thirst.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Those who swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, ‘As your god, Dan, lives;’ and, ‘As the way of Beersheba lives;’ they will fall, and never rise up again.”</verse>
