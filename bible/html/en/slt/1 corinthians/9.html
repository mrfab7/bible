<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Corinthians" data-chapter="9" data-translation="Smith's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="slt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Am I not sent? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are ye not my work in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">If to others I am not sent, but surely I am to you: for the seal of my sending are ye in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">My justification to them examining me is this,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">have we not power to eat and to drink?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife; as also the rest of the sent, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Or I only and Barnabas, have we not power not to work?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Who makes war at any time at his own charges who plants a vineyard, and eats not of its fruit or who feeds a flock, and eats not of the milk of the flock?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Not according to man do I speak these things: or does not the law also say these things?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For in the law of Moses has been written, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox grinding. Is there not care to God for oxen?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Or does he say altogether on account of us? For it was written on account of us: that he ploughing ought to plough upon hope; and he grinding upon hope, to participate with his hope.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">If we have sown to you spiritual things, is it great if we shall reap your carnal things?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">If others participate with your power, not rather we? But we used not this power; but endure all things, lest we give some hindrance to the good news of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Do ye not know that they working consecrated things, eat of the temple? they working diligently at the altar, share together with the altar?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Thus also the Lord appointed to them announcing good news to live of the good news.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But I used none of these things: and I wrote not these things, that thus it might be with me: for good to me rather to die, than that any should render my boasting void.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For if I announce the good news, there is no boasting to me: for necessity is laid upon me; and woe is to me, if I announce not the good news!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For if of free will I do this, I have reward: and if unwillingly, I have been entrusted with a stewardship.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">What reward therefore is to me? That announcing good news, I shall make the good news of Christ not expensive, not to make use of my power in the good news.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For being free from all, I have subjected myself to all, that I might gain the more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And I was to the Jews as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews: to them under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them under the law;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">To the lawless, as lawless, (not being lawless to God, but subject to the law to Christ,) that I might gain the lawless,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">I became to the weak as weak, that I might gain the weak: I have been all things to all, that altogether I might save some.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And this I do on account of the good news, that I might become a partaker of it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Do ye not know that they running in a race-course, all truly run, and one receives the prize of combat? Do ye so run, that ye might receive.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And every one contending for the prize, has self command in all things. These surely therefore that they might receive a corruptible crown; and we an incorruptible.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">I therefore so run, as not uncertainly; so practise I pugilism, as not laying stripes upon air:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">But I give my body a blow under the eyes, and reduce to bondage: lest having proclaimed to others, I myself be rejected.</p>
