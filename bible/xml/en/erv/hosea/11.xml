<chapter book="Hosea" number="11" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="2">As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto the Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Yet I taught Ephraim to go; I took them on my arms; but they knew not that I healed them.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love; and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat before them.</verse>
  <verse number="5">He shall not return into the land of Egypt; but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the sword shall fall upon his cities, and shall consume his bars, and devour them, because of their own counsels.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they call them to him that is on high, none at all will exalt him.</verse>
  <verse number="8">How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my compassions are kindled together.</verse>
  <verse number="9">I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city.</verse>
  <verse number="10">They shall walk after the LORD, who shall roar like a lion: for he shall roar, and the children shall come trembling from the west.</verse>
  <verse number="11">They shall come trembling as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will make them to dwell in their houses, saith the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Ephraim compasseth me about with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the Holy One.</verse>
