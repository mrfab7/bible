<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea exists no more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And I heard a loud voice out of the heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God [is] with men, and he shall tabernacle with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, their God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And he shall wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death shall not exist any more, nor grief, nor cry, nor distress shall exist any more, for the former things have passed away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And he that sat on the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he says [to me], Write, for these words are true and faithful.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And he said to me, It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to him that thirsts of the fountain of the water of life freely.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He that overcomes shall inherit these things, and I will be to him God, and he shall be to me son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But to the fearful and unbelieving, [and sinners], and those who make themselves abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, their part [is] in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone; which is the second death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And there came one of the seven angels which had had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues, and spoke with me, saying, Come here, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb’s wife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And he carried me away in [the] Spirit, [and set me] on a great and high mountain, and shewed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">having the glory of God. Her shining [was] like a most precious stone, as a crystal-like jasper stone;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">having a great and high wall; having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names inscribed, which are those of the twelve tribes of [the] sons of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">On [the] east three gates; and on [the] north three gates; and on [the] south three gates; and on [the] west three gates.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And he that spoke with me had a golden reed [as] a measure, that he might measure the city, and its gates, and its wall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And the city lies four-square, and its length [is] as much as the breadth. And he measured the city with the reed—twelve thousand stadia: the length and the breadth and height of it are equal.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And he measured its wall, a hundred [and] forty-four cubits, [a] man’s measure, that is, [the] angel’s.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And the building of its wall [was] jasper; and the city pure gold, like pure glass:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">the foundations of the wall of the city [were] adorned with every precious stone: the first foundation, jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprasus; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And the twelve gates, twelve pearls; each one of the gates, respectively, was of one pearl; and the street of the city pure gold, as transparent glass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And I saw no temple in it; for the Lord God Almighty is its temple, and the Lamb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And the city has no need of the sun nor of the moon, that they should shine for it; for the glory of God has enlightened it, and the lamp thereof [is] the Lamb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And the nations shall walk by its light; and the kings of the earth bring their glory to it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And its gates shall not be shut at all by day, for night shall not be there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And they shall bring the glory and the honour of the nations to it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And nothing common, nor that maketh an abomination and a lie, shall at all enter into it; but those only who [are] written in the book of life of the Lamb.</p>
