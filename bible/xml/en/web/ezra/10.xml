  <verse number="1">Now while Ezra prayed and made confession, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there was gathered together to him out of Israel a very great assembly of men and women and children; for the people wept very bitterly.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered Ezra, “We have trespassed against our God, and have married foreign women of the peoples of the land. Yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God. Let it be done according to the law.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Arise; for the matter belongs to you, and we are with you. Be courageous, and do it.”</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then Ezra arose, and made the chiefs of the priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word. So they swore.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the room of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came there, he ate no bread, nor drank water; for he mourned because of their trespass of the captivity.</verse>
  <verse number="7">They made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together to Jerusalem;</verse>
  <verse number="8">and that whoever didn’t come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the assembly of the captivity.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together to Jerusalem within the three days; it was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month: and all the people sat in the broad place before the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Ezra the priest stood up, and said to them, “You have trespassed, and have married foreign women, to increase the guilt of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Now therefore make confession to Yahweh, the God of your fathers, and do his pleasure; and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land, and from the foreign women.”</verse>
  <verse number="12">Then all the assembly answered with a loud voice, “As you have said concerning us, so must we do.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand outside; neither is this a work of one day or two; for we have greatly transgressed in this matter.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Let now our princes be appointed for all the assembly, and let all those who are in our cities who have married foreign women come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and its judges, until the fierce wrath of our God be turned from us, until this matter is resolved.”</verse>
  <verse number="15">Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah stood up against this; and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.</verse>
  <verse number="16">The children of the captivity did so. Ezra the priest, with certain heads of fathers’ households, after their fathers’ houses, and all of them by their names, were set apart; and they sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.</verse>
  <verse number="17">They made an end with all the men who had married foreign women by the first day of the first month.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Among the sons of the priests there were found who had married foreign women: of the sons of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and his brothers, Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.</verse>
  <verse number="19">They gave their hand that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their guilt.</verse>
