<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="9" data-translation="World English Bible" data-translation-id="web" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Wisdom has built her house. She has carved out her seven pillars.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">She has prepared her meat. She has mixed her wine. She has also set her table.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">She has sent out her maidens. She cries from the highest places of the city:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">“Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!” As for him who is void of understanding, she says to him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">“Come, eat some of my bread, Drink some of the wine which I have mixed!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Leave your simple ways, and live. Walk in the way of understanding.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He who corrects a mocker invites insult. He who reproves a wicked man invites abuse.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Don’t reprove a scoffer, lest he hate you. Reprove a wise man, and he will love you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Instruct a wise man, and he will be still wiser. Teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom. The knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For by me your days will be multiplied. The years of your life will be increased.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">If you are wise, you are wise for yourself. If you mock, you alone will bear it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The foolish woman is loud, Undisciplined, and knows nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">She sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">To call to those who pass by, who go straight on their ways,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">“Whoever is simple, let him turn in here.” as for him who is void of understanding, she says to him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">“Stolen water is sweet. Food eaten in secret is pleasant.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But he doesn’t know that the dead are there, that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.</p>
