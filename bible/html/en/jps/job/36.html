<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Elihu also proceeded, and said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Suffer me a little, and I will tell thee; For there are yet words on God’s behalf.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I will fetch my knowledge from afar, And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For truly my words are not false; One that is upright in mind is with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Behold, God is mighty, yet He despiseth not any; He is mighty in strength of understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He preserveth not the life of the wicked; But giveth to the poor their right.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He withdraweth not His eyes from the righteous; But with kings upon the throne He setteth them for ever, and they are exalted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And if they be bound in fetters, And be holden in cords of affliction;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Then He declareth unto them their work, And their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He openeth also their ear to discipline, And commandeth that they return from iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">If they hearken and serve Him, They shall spend their days in prosperity, And their years in pleasures.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But if they hearken not, they shall perish by the sword, And they shall die without knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But they that are godless in heart lay up anger; They cry not for help when He bindeth them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Their soul perisheth in youth, And their life as that of the depraved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He delivereth the afflicted by His affliction, And openeth their ear by tribulation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Yea, He hath allured thee out of distress Into a broad place, where there is no straitness; And that which is set on thy table is full of fatness;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And thou art full of the judgment of the wicked; Judgment and justice take hold on them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For beware of wrath, lest thou be led away by thy sufficiency; Neither let the greatness of the ransom turn thee aside.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Will thy riches avail, that are without stint, Or all the forces of thy strength?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Desire not the night, When peoples are cut off in their place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Take heed, regard not iniquity; For this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Behold, God doeth loftily in His power; Who is a teacher like Him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Who hath enjoined Him His way? Or who hath said: ‘Thou hast wrought unrighteousness’?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Remember that thou magnify His work, Whereof men have sung.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">All men have looked thereon; Man beholdeth it afar off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Behold, God is great, beyond our knowledge; The number of His years is unsearchable.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For He draweth away the drops of water, Which distil rain from His vapour;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Which the skies pour down And drop upon the multitudes of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Yea, can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, The crashings of His pavilion?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Behold, He spreadeth His light upon it; And He covereth the depths of the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">For by these He judgeth the peoples; He giveth food in abundance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">He covereth His hands with the lightning, And giveth it a charge that it strike the mark.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">The noise thereof telleth concerning it, The cattle also concerning the storm that cometh up.</p>
