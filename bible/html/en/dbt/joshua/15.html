<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families was: to the border of Edom, the wilderness of Zin, southward, in the extreme south.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And their southern border was from the end of the salt sea, from the tongue that turns southward;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and it went out south of the ascent of Akrabbim, and passed on to Zin, and went up on the south of Kadesh-barnea, and passed to Hezron, and went up toward Addar, and turned toward Karkaah,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">and passed on to Azmon, and went out by the torrent of Egypt; and the border ended at the sea. That shall be your border southward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">—And the eastern border was the salt sea as far as the end of the Jordan.—And the border on the north side was from the tongue of the salt sea, at the end of the Jordan;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and the border went up toward Beth-hoglah, and passed north of Beth-Arabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan, the son of Reuben;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">and the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and turned northward to Gilgal, which is opposite to the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the torrent; and the border passed to the waters of En-shemesh, and ended at En-rogel;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">and the border went up to the valley of the son of Hinnom, toward the south side of the Jebusite, that is, Jerusalem; and the border went up to the top of the mountain that is before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the valley of Rephaim northward;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">and the border reached along from the top of the mountain toward the spring of the waters of Nephtoah, and went out toward the cities of mount Ephron; and the border reached along to Baalah, that is, Kirjath-jearim;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">and the border turned from Baalah westwards toward mount Seir, and passed toward the side of Har-jearim, that is, Chesalon, northwards, and went down to Beth-shemesh, and passed Timnah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And the border went out to the side of Ekron northwards, and the border reached along toward Shicron, and passed mount Baalah, and went toward Jabneel; and the border ended at the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">—And the west border is the great sea and [its] coast. This is the border of the children of Judah round about, according to their families.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And to Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a portion among the children of Judah according to the commandment of Jehovah to Joshua, the city of Arba, the father of Anak, that is, Hebron.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And thence Caleb dispossessed the three sons of Anak, Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai, who were born of Anak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And from there he went up against the inhabitants of Debir; now the name of Debir before was Kirjath-sepher.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Caleb said, He that smites Kirjath-sepher and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it; and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And it came to pass as she came, that she urged him to ask of her father a field; and she sprang down from the ass. And Caleb said to her, What wouldest thou?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And she said, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a southern land; give me also springs of water. Then he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families.</p>
