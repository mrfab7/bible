<chapter book="Job" number="29" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And Job continued his parable and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when +God preserved me;</verse>
  <verse number="3">When his lamp shone over my head, [and] by his light I walked through darkness;</verse>
  <verse number="4">As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret counsel of +God was over my tent,</verse>
  <verse number="5">When the Almighty was yet with me, my young men round about me;</verse>
  <verse number="6">When my steps were bathed in milk, and the rock poured out beside me rivers of oil!...</verse>
  <verse number="7">When I went out to the gate by the city, when I prepared my seat on the broadway,</verse>
  <verse number="8">The young men saw me, and hid themselves; and the aged arose [and] stood up;</verse>
  <verse number="9">Princes refrained from talking, and laid the hand on their mouth;</verse>
  <verse number="10">The voice of the nobles was hushed, and their tongue cleaved to their palate.</verse>
  <verse number="11">When the ear heard [me], then it blessed me, and when the eye saw [me], it gave witness to me;</verse>
  <verse number="12">For I delivered the afflicted that cried, and the fatherless who had no helper.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The blessing of him that was perishing came upon me, and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; my justice was as a mantle and a turban.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame;</verse>
  <verse number="16">I was a father to the needy, and the cause which I knew not I searched out;</verse>
  <verse number="17">And I broke the jaws of the unrighteous, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And I said, I shall die in my nest, and multiply my days as the sand;</verse>
  <verse number="19">My root shall be spread out to the waters, and the dew will lie all night on my branch;</verse>
  <verse number="20">My glory shall be fresh in me, and my bow be renewed in my hand.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Unto me they listened, and waited, and kept silence for my counsel:</verse>
  <verse number="22">After my words they spoke not again, and my speech dropped upon them;</verse>
  <verse number="23">And they waited for me as for the rain, and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.</verse>
  <verse number="24">[If] I laughed on them, they believed [it] not; and they troubled not the serenity of my countenance.</verse>
  <verse number="25">I chose their way, and sat as chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth mourners.</verse>
