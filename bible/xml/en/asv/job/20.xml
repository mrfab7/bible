  <verse number="1">Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Therefore do my thoughts give answer to me, Even by reason of my haste that is in me.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I have heard the reproof which putteth me to shame; And the spirit of my understanding answereth me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Knowest thou not this of old time, Since man was placed upon earth,</verse>
  <verse number="5">That the triumphing of the wicked is short, And the joy of the godless but for a moment?</verse>
  <verse number="6">Though his height mount up to the heavens, And his head reach unto the clouds;</verse>
  <verse number="7">Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: They that have seen him shall say, Where is he?</verse>
  <verse number="8">He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: Yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The eye which saw him shall see him no more; Neither shall his place any more behold him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">His children shall seek the favor of the poor, And his hands shall give back his wealth.</verse>
  <verse number="11">His bones are full of his youth, But it shall lie down with him in the dust.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, Though he hide it under his tongue,</verse>
  <verse number="13">Though he spare it, and will not let it go, But keep it still within his mouth;</verse>
  <verse number="14">Yet his food in his bowels is turned, It is the gall of asps within him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again; God will cast them out of his belly.</verse>
  <verse number="16">He shall suck the poison of asps: The viper’s tongue shall slay him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">He shall not look upon the rivers, The flowing streams of honey and butter.</verse>
  <verse number="18">That which he labored for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down; According to the substance that he hath gotten, he shall not rejoice.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For he hath oppressed and forsaken the poor; He hath violently taken away a house, and he shall not build it up.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Because he knew no quietness within him, He shall not save aught of that wherein he delighteth.</verse>
  <verse number="21">There was nothing left that he devoured not; Therefore his prosperity shall not endure.</verse>
  <verse number="22">In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: The hand of every one that is in misery shall come upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="23">When he is about to fill his belly, God will cast the fierceness of his wrath upon him, And will rain it upon him while he is eating.</verse>
  <verse number="24">He shall flee from the iron weapon, And the bow of brass shall strike him through.</verse>
  <verse number="25">He draweth it forth, and it cometh out of his body; Yea, the glittering point cometh out of his gall: Terrors are upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="26">All darkness is laid up for his treasures: A fire not blown by man shall devour him; It shall consume that which is left in his tent.</verse>
  <verse number="27">The heavens shall reveal his iniquity, And the earth shall rise up against him.</verse>
  <verse number="28">The increase of his house shall depart; His goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.</verse>
  <verse number="29">This is the portion of a wicked man from God, And the heritage appointed unto him by God.</verse>
