<chapter book="Jeremiah" number="33" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Thus said the LORD the maker thereof, the LORD that formed it, to establish it; the LORD is his name;</verse>
  <verse number="3">Call to me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you know not.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For thus said the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword;</verse>
  <verse number="5">They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but it is to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in my anger and in my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal to them the abundance of peace and truth.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honor before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do to them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure to it.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Thus said the LORD; Again there shall be heard in this place, which you say shall be desolate without man and without beast, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast,</verse>
  <verse number="11">The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD is good; for his mercy endures for ever: and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD. For I will cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the first, said the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Thus said the LORD of hosts; Again in this place, which is desolate without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, shall be an habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.</verse>
  <verse number="13">In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that tells them, said the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will perform that good thing which I have promised to the house of Israel and to the house of Judah.</verse>
  <verse number="15">In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up to David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land.</verse>
  <verse number="16">In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely: and this is the name with which she shall be called, The LORD our righteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For thus said the LORD; David shall never want a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel;</verse>
  <verse number="18">Neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="20">Thus said the LORD; If you can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night in their season;</verse>
  <verse number="21">Then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he should not have a son to reign on his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.</verse>
  <verse number="22">As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister to me.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="24">Consider you not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the LORD has chosen, he has even cast them off? thus they have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Thus said the LORD; If my covenant be not with day and night, and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;</verse>
  <verse number="26">Then will I cast away the seed of Jacob and David my servant, so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and have mercy on them.</verse>
