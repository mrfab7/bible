<chapter book="Galatians" number="1" translation="Webster Bible Translation" translationID="wbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Paul, an apostle, (not from men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)</verse>
  <verse number="2">And all the brethren who are with me, to the churches of Galatia:</verse>
  <verse number="3">Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
  <verse number="4">Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:</verse>
  <verse number="5">To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
  <verse number="6">I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ, to another gospel:</verse>
  <verse number="7">Which is not another; but there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach any other gospel to you than that which we have preached to you, let him be accursed.</verse>
  <verse number="9">As we said before, so I say now again, If any man preacheth any other gospel to you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For I neither received it from man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For ye have heard of my manner of life in time past in the Jews’ religion, that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it;</verse>
  <verse number="14">And profited in the Jews’ religion above many my equals in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called me by his grace,</verse>
  <verse number="16">To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:</verse>
  <verse number="17">Neither did I go to Jerusalem to them who were apostles before me: but I went into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Then after three years I went to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.</verse>
  <verse number="19">But I saw no other of the apostles, save James the Lord’s brother.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Now the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I lie not.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;</verse>
  <verse number="22">And was unknown by face to the churches of Judea which were in Christ:</verse>
  <verse number="23">But they had heard only, That he who persecuted us in times past, now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And they glorified God in me.</verse>
