<chapter book="Isaiah" number="32" translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" translationID="drb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">BEHOLD a king shall reign in justice, and princes shell rule in judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And a man shall be as when one is hid from the wind, and hideth himself from a storm, as rivers of waters in drought, and the shadow of a rock that standeth out in a desert land.</verse>
  <verse number="3">The eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear shall hearken diligently.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the heart of fools shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of stammerers shall speak readily and plain.</verse>
  <verse number="5">The fool shall no more be called prince: neither shall the deceitful be called great:</verse>
  <verse number="6">For the fool will speak foolish things, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and speak to the Lord deceitfully, and to make empty the soul of the hungry, and take away drink from the thirsty.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The vessels of the deceitful are most wicked: for he hath framed devices to destroy the meek, with lying words, when the poor man speaketh judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But the prince will devise such things as are worthy of a prince, and he shah stand above the rulers.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Rise up, ye rich women, and hear my voice: ye confident daughters, give ear to my speech.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For after days and a year, you that are confident shall be troubled: for the vintage is at an end, the gathering shall come no more.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Be astonished, ye rich women, be troubled, ye confident ones: strip yen, and be confounded, gird your loins.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Mourn for your breasts, for the delightful country, for the fruitful vineyard.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Upon the land of my people shall thorns and briers come up: how much more upon all the houses of joy, of the city that rejoiced?</verse>
  <verse number="14">For the house is forsaken, the multitude of the city is left, darkness and obscurity are come upon its dens for ever. A joy of wild asses, the pastures of docks,</verse>
  <verse number="15">Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high: and the desert shall be se a charmel, and charmel shall be counted for a forest.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and justice shall sit in charmel.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the work of justice shall be peace, and the service of justice quietness, and security for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And my people shall sit in the beauty of peace, and in the tabernacles of confidence, and in wealthy rest.</verse>
  <verse number="19">But hail shall be in the descent of the forest, and the city shall be made very low.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Blessed are ye that sow upon all waters, sending thither the foot of the ox and the ass.</verse>
