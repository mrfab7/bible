<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, [even] Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.</p>
