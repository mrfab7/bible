<p class="verse" data-verse="52">you must drive out before you all the inhabitants of the land, destroy all their carved images and cast idols, and demolish all their high places.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">You are to take possession of the land and settle in it, for I have given you the land to possess.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="54">And you are to divide the land by lot according to your clans. Give a larger inheritance to a larger clan and a smaller inheritance to a smaller one. Whatever falls to each one by lot will be his. You will receive an inheritance according to the tribes of your fathers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="55">But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land before you, those you allow to remain will become barbs in your eyes and thorns in your sides; they will harass you in the land where you settle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="56">And then I will do to you what I had planned to do to them.”</p>
