<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="16" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">It is for man to prepare the soul, and for the Lord to govern the tongue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">All the ways of a man are open to his eyes; the Lord is the one who weighs spirits.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Open your works to the Lord, and your intentions will be set in order.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The Lord has wrought all things because of himself. Likewise the impious is for the evil day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">All the arrogant are an abomination to the Lord. Even if hand will be joined to hand, he is not innocent. The beginning of a good way is to do justice. And this is more acceptable with God than to immolate sacrifices.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">By mercy and truth, iniquity is redeemed. And by the fear of the Lord, one turns away from evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">When the ways of man will please the Lord, he will convert even his enemies to peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Better is a little with justice, than many fruits with iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The heart of man disposes his way. But it is for Lord to direct his steps.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Foreknowledge is in the lips of the king. His mouth shall not err in judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Weights and scales are judgments of the Lord. And all the stones in the bag are his work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Those who act impiously are abominable to the king. For the throne is made firm by justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Just lips are the will of kings. He who speaks honestly shall be loved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The indignation of a king is a herald of death. And the wise man will appease it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">In the cheerfulness of the kingâ€™s countenance, there is life. And his clemency is like belated rain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Possess wisdom, for it is better than gold. And acquire prudence, for it is more precious than silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The path of the just turns away from evils. He who guards his soul preserves his way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Arrogance precedes destruction. And the spirit is exalted before a fall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">It is better to be humbled with the meek, than to divide spoils with the arrogant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The learned in word shall find good things. And whoever hopes in the Lord is blessed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Whoever is wise in heart shall be called prudent. And whoever is sweet in eloquence shall attain to what is greater.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Learning is a fountain of life to one who possesses it. The doctrine of the foolish is senseless.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The heart of the wise shall instruct his mouth and add grace to his lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Careful words are a honeycomb: sweet to the soul and healthful to the bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">There is a way which seems right to a man, and its end result leads to death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">The soul of the laborer labors for himself, because his mouth has driven him to it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The impious man digs up evil, and in his lips is a burning fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">A perverse man stirs up lawsuits. And one who is verbose divides leaders.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">A man of iniquity entices his friend, and he leads him along a way that is not good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Whoever, with astonished eyes, thinks up depravities, biting his lips, accomplishes evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Old age is a crown of dignity, when it is found in the ways of justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">A patient man is better than a strong one. And whoever rules his soul is better than one who assaults cities.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Lots are cast into the lap, but they are tempered by the Lord.</p>
