<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Surely there is a mine for silver, and a place for gold which they refine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the stone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Man setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out to the furthest bound the stones of thick darkness and of the shadow of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">He breaketh open a shaft away from where men sojourn; they are forgotten of the foot that passeth by; they hang afar from men, they swing to and fro.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and underneath it is turned up as it were by fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The stones thereof are the place of sapphires, and it hath dust of gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">That path no bird of prey knoweth, neither hath the falconâ€™s eye seen it:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The proud beasts have not trodden it, nor hath the fierce lion passed thereby.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He putteth forth his hand upon the flinty rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He cutteth out channels among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He bindeth the streams that they trickle not; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The deep saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Gold and glass cannot equal it: neither shall the exchange thereof be jewels of fine gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal: yea, the price of wisdom is above rubies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Destruction and Death say, We have heard a rumour thereof with our ears.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">To make a weight for the wind; yea, he meteth out the waters by measure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Then did he see it, and declare it; he established it, yea, and searched it out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.</p>
