  <verse number="1">Job also added, taking up his parable, and said:</verse>
  <verse number="2">As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment, and the Almighty, who hath brought my soul to bitterness,</verse>
  <verse number="3">As long as breath remaineth in me, and the spirit of God in my nostrils,</verse>
  <verse number="4">My lips shall not speak iniquity, neither shall my tongue contrive lying.</verse>
  <verse number="5">God forbid that I should judge you to be just: till I die I will not depart from my innocence.</verse>
  <verse number="6">My justification, which I have begun to hold, I will not forsake: for my heart doth not reprehend me in all my life.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Let my enemy be as the ungodly, and my adversary as the wicked one.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For what is the hope of the hypocrite if through covetousness he take by violence, and God deliver not his soul?</verse>
  <verse number="9">Will God hear his cry, when distress shall come upon him?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Or can he delight himself in the Almighty, and call upon God at all times?</verse>
  <verse number="11">I will teach you by the hand of God, what the Almighty hath, and I will not conceal it.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Behold you all know it, and why do you speak vain things without cause?</verse>
  <verse number="13">This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the inheritance of the violent, which they shall receive of the Almighty.</verse>
  <verse number="14">If his sons be multiplied, they shall be for the sword, and his grandsons shall not be filled with bread.</verse>
  <verse number="15">They that shall remain of him, shall be buried in death, and his widows shall not weep.</verse>
  <verse number="16">If he shall heap together silver as earth, and prepare raiment as clay,</verse>
  <verse number="17">He shall prepare indeed, but the just man shall be clothed with it: and the innocent shall divide the silver.</verse>
  <verse number="18">He hath built his house as a moth, and as a keeper he hath made a booth.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The rich man when he shall sleep shall take away nothing with him: he shall open his eyes and find nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Poverty like water shall take hold on him, a tempest shall oppress him in the night.</verse>
  <verse number="21">A burning wind shall take him up, and carry him away, and as a whirlwind shall snatch him from his place.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And he shall cast upon him, and shall not spare: out of his hand he would willingly flee.</verse>
  <verse number="23">He shall clasp his hands upon him, and shall hiss at him, beholding his place.</verse>
