<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now the word of the LORD came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">But Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man to his god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">So the shipmaster came to him, and said to him, What mean you, O sleeper? arise, call on your God, if so be that God will think on us, that we perish not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is on us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Then said they to him, Tell us, we pray you, for whose cause this evil is on us; What is your occupation? and from where come you? what is your country? and of what people are you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And he said to them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven, which has made the sea and the dry land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said to him. Why have you done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Then said they to him, What shall we do to you, that the sea may be calm to us? for the sea worked, and was tempestuous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And he said to them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm to you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is on you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they could not: for the sea worked, and was tempestuous against them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Why they cried to the LORD, and said, We beseech you, O LORD, we beseech you, let us not perish for this manâ€™s life, and lay not on us innocent blood: for you, O LORD, have done as it pleased you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">So they look up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice to the LORD, and made vows.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.</p>
