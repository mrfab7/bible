  <verse number="1">And quickly the chief priests having made counsel with the more ancient and scribes and the whole council, having bound Jesus, led away, and delivered to Pilate.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And having answered, he said to him, Thou sayest.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the chief priests accused him much.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Pilate again asked him, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how much they accuse thee.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate wondered.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And at the festival he loosed to them one in bonds, whomsoever they asked.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And there was he called Barabbas, bound with those exciting sedition, who did murder in the revolt.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the crowd having cried, began to ask as he did always to them.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye I loose to you the King of the Jews?</verse>
  <verse number="10">For he knew that through envy the chief priests had delivered him up:</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the chief priests moved the crowd, that he would rather loose Barabbas to them.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Pilate having answered, again said to them, What then will ye I should do to him whom ye call King of the Jews?</verse>
  <verse number="13">And again they cried out, Crucify him.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Pilate said to them, But what evil has he done? And they cried out more excessively, Crucify him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Pilate, willing to satisfy the crowd, loosed to them Barabbas, and delivered Jesus, having scourged, that he might be crucified.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And the soldiers led him away within the hall, which is the Pretorium; and they call together the whole band.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And they clothed him with purple, and put round him, having woven, a thorny crown.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And they began to greet him, Hail, O King of the Jews.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And they struck his head with a reed, and they spit upon him, and having placed the knees, they worshipped him.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And when they mocked him, they put off the purple from him, and clothed him with his own garments, and led him out that they might crucify him.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And they constrain a certain Simon, a Cyrenian, passing by, coming from the field, the father of Alexander and Rufus, that he might take up his cross.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And they bring him to the place Golgotha, which is, interpreted, The place of a skull.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And they gave him wine to drink, prepared with myrrh: and he took not.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And having crucified him, they divided his garments, casting lots upon what any should take up.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And it was the third hour, and they crucified him:</verse>
  <verse number="26">And the inscription of his accusation was inscribed above, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And with him they crucify two robbers; one from the right, and one from the left.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And the writing was completed, saying, And he was reckoned with the lawless.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And they going by blasphemed him, shaking their heads, and saying, Ah, thou loosing the temple, and building in three days,</verse>
  <verse number="30">Save thyself, and come down from the cross.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And likewise also the chief priests, mocking to one another with the scribes, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Let Christ, King of Israel, come down from the cross, that we might see and believe. And they crucified with him reproached him.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And being the sixth hour, darkness was upon the whole earth till the ninth hour.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a great voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, for what hast thou forsaken me?</verse>
  <verse number="35">And some of them standing by, having heard, said, Behold, he calls Elias.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And one running and having filled a sponge with vinegar, and put round a reed, gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see if Elias will come to take him down.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And Jesus having let go a great voice, expired.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And the veil of the temple was split in two from above to below.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And the centurion, standing over against him, having seen that having so cried out he expired, said, Truly this man was the Son- of God.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And women also were beholding from far: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary of James the small and the mother of Joses, and Salome;</verse>
  <verse number="41">(And they, when he was in Galilee, followed him and served him;) and many other women, having come up with him to Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And being already evening, for it was the preparation, which is before sabbath,</verse>
  <verse number="43">Joseph came from Arimathea, a distinguished counsellor, who also himself was expecting the kingdom of God, having ventured, he went in to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="44">And Pilate wondered if he were already dead: and having called the centurion, he asked him if he had been dead long ago.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And having known from the centurion, he bestowed the body to Joseph.</verse>
  <verse number="46">And having bought fine linen, and taken him down, he rolled in fine linen, and placed him in a tomb, which was quarried out of a rock, and he rolled a stone at the door of the tomb.</verse>
  <verse number="47">And Mary Magdalene and Mari of Joses were beholding where he is laid.</verse>
