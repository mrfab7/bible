  <verse number="1">Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,</verse>
  <verse number="2">“Should a wise man answer with vain knowledge, and fill himself with the east wind?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Should he reason with unprofitable talk, or with speeches with which he can do no good?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Yes, you do away with fear, and hinder devotion before God.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For your iniquity teaches your mouth, and you choose the language of the crafty.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Your own mouth condemns you, and not I. Yes, your own lips testify against you.</verse>
  <verse number="7">“Are you the first man who was born? Or were you brought forth before the hills?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Have you heard the secret counsel of God? Do you limit wisdom to yourself?</verse>
  <verse number="9">What do you know, that we don’t know? What do you understand, which is not in us?</verse>
  <verse number="10">With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men, much elder than your father.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Are the consolations of God too small for you, even the word that is gentle toward you?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Why does your heart carry you away? Why do your eyes flash,</verse>
  <verse number="13">That you turn your spirit against God, and let such words go out of your mouth?</verse>
  <verse number="14">What is man, that he should be clean? What is he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?</verse>
  <verse number="15">Behold, he puts no trust in his holy ones. Yes, the heavens are not clean in his sight;</verse>
  <verse number="16">how much less one who is abominable and corrupt, a man who drinks iniquity like water!</verse>
  <verse number="17">“I will show you, listen to me; that which I have seen I will declare:</verse>
  <verse number="18">(Which wise men have told by their fathers, and have not hidden it;</verse>
  <verse number="19">to whom alone the land was given, and no stranger passed among them):</verse>
  <verse number="20">the wicked man writhes in pain all his days, even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor.</verse>
  <verse number="21">A sound of terrors is in his ears. In prosperity the destroyer shall come on him.</verse>
  <verse number="22">He doesn’t believe that he shall return out of darkness. He is waited for by the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="23">He wanders abroad for bread, saying, ‘Where is it?’ He knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Distress and anguish make him afraid. They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Because he has stretched out his hand against God, and behaves himself proudly against the Almighty;</verse>
  <verse number="26">he runs at him with a stiff neck, with the thick shields of his bucklers;</verse>
  <verse number="27">because he has covered his face with his fatness, and gathered fat on his thighs.</verse>
  <verse number="28">He has lived in desolate cities, in houses which no one inhabited, which were ready to become heaps.</verse>
  <verse number="29">He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall their possessions be extended on the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="30">He shall not depart out of darkness. The flame shall dry up his branches. By the breath of God’s mouth shall he go away.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Let him not trust in emptiness, deceiving himself; for emptiness shall be his reward.</verse>
  <verse number="32">It shall be accomplished before his time. His branch shall not be green.</verse>
  <verse number="33">He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive tree.</verse>
  <verse number="34">For the company of the godless shall be barren, and fire shall consume the tents of bribery.</verse>
  <verse number="35">They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity. Their heart prepares deceit.”</verse>
