  <verse number="1">In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream; he told the sum of the matters.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Daniel spoke and said, I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of the heavens broke forth upon the great sea.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And four great beasts came up from the sea, different one from another.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings: I beheld till its wings were plucked; and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand upon two feet as a man, and a man’s heart was given to it.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And behold, another beast, a second, like unto a bear, and it raised up itself on one side; and [it had] three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and they said thus unto it: Arise, devour much flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="6">After this I saw, and behold, another, like a leopard, and it had four wings of a bird upon its back; and the beast had four heads; and dominion was given to it.</verse>
  <verse number="7">After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and exceeding strong; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the rest with its feet; and it was different from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.</verse>
  <verse number="8">I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another, a little horn, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots; and behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.</verse>
  <verse number="9">I beheld till thrones were set, and the Ancient of days did sit: his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was flames of fire, [and] its wheels burning fire.</verse>
  <verse number="10">A stream of fire issued and came forth from before him; thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</verse>
  <verse number="11">I beheld therefore, because of the voice of the great words that the horn spoke; I beheld till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given up to be burned with fire.</verse>
  <verse number="12">As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away; but their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.</verse>
  <verse number="13">I saw in the night visions, and behold, there came with the clouds of heaven [one] like a son of man, and he came up even to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom [that] which shall not be destroyed.</verse>
  <verse number="15">As for me Daniel, my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the certainty of all this. And he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things:</verse>
  <verse number="17">These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, [that] shall arise out of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But the saints of the most high [places] shall receive the kingdom, and they shall possess the kingdom for ever, even to the ages of ages.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Then I desired to know the certainty concerning the fourth beast, which was different from them all, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the rest with its feet;</verse>
  <verse number="20">and concerning the ten horns that were in its head, and the other that came up, and before which three fell: even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth speaking great things, and whose look was more imposing than its fellows.</verse>
  <verse number="21">I beheld, and that horn made war with the saints, and prevailed over them;</verse>
  <verse number="22">until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most high [places]; and the appointed time arrived, and the saints possessed the kingdom.</verse>
  <verse number="23">He said thus: The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon the earth, which shall be different from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And as to the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall arise ten kings; and another shall arise after them; and he shall be different from the former, and he shall subdue three kings.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most high [places], and think to change seasons and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and a half time.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.</verse>
  <verse number="27">But the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heavens, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most high [places]. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.</verse>
  <verse number="28">So far is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my thoughts much troubled me, and my countenance was changed in me; but I kept the matter in my heart.</verse>
