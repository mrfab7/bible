  <verse number="1">And the Pharisees and Sadducees having come, tempting, asked him to shew them a sign from heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he having answered, said to them, It being evening, ye say, Calm weather: for the heaven is fiery red.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And in the morning, Today, wintry weather: for heaven, being sad, is fiery red. Hypocrites, truly ye know to decide the face of heaven, but the signs of the times ye cannot.</verse>
  <verse number="4">An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign; and no sign shall be given her, except the sign of Jonas the prophet. And having left them, he departed.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And his disciples having come to the other side, forgot to take loaves.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Jesus said to them, Attend and keep from the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And they reasoned among themselves, saying, Because we took no loaves.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Jesus having known, said to them, Why reason ye among yourselves, O ye of little faith, because ye have taken no loaves.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Do ye not yet understand, nor remember the five loaves of five thousand, and how many baskets ye took?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Nor the seven loaves of four thousand, and how many wicker baskets ye took?</verse>
  <verse number="11">How do ye not understand that I spake not to you concerning bread, to keep from the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Then understood they that he spake, not to keep from the leaven of bread, but from the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And Jesus, having come into the parts of Caesarea of Philippi, asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say me to be, the Son of Man?</verse>
  <verse number="14">And they said, Some, truly, John the Baptist: and others, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And he says to them, But whom say ye me to be?</verse>
  <verse number="16">And Simon Peter having answered, said, Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And Jesus, having answered, said to him, Happy art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood has not revealed to thee, but my Father, he in the heavens.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And I say to thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I build my church; and the gates of hell shall not overcome her.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens: and whatever thou shalt bind upon earth shall be bound in the heavens: and whatever thou shalt loose upon earth shall be loosed in the heavens.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Then he enjoined his disciples that they say to none that he is Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="21">From then Jesus began to shew to his disciples, that he must depart to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised in the third day.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And Peter having taken him, began to reproach him, saying, Be propitious to thyself, Lord: this shall not be to thee.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And having turned, he said to Peter, Retire behind me, Satan: thou art an offence, to me: for thou hast not in mind the things of God, but the things of men.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Then said Jesus to his disciples, If any wish to come after me, let him deny himself absolutely, and lift up his cross, and follow me.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For whoever should wish to save his life shall lose it: and whoever shall lose his soul for my sake shall find it.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For what is a man profited, if he should gain the whole world, and injure his soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</verse>
  <verse number="27">For the Son of man is about to come in the glory of his Father with his messengers; and then he will give back to each according to his deed.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Verily I say to you, Some are standing here, who should not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.</verse>
