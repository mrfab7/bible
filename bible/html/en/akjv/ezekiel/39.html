<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Therefore, you son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against you, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And I will turn you back, and leave but the sixth part of you, and will cause you to come up from the north parts, and will bring you on the mountains of Israel:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And I will smite your bow out of your left hand, and will cause your arrows to fall out of your right hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">You shall fall on the mountains of Israel, you, and all your bands, and the people that is with you: I will give you to the ravenous birds of every sort, and to the beasts of the field to be devoured.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">You shall fall on the open field: for I have spoken it, said the Lord GOD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell carelessly in the isles: and they shall know that I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">So will I make my holy name known in the middle of my people Israel; and I will not let them pollute my holy name any more: and the heathen shall know that I am the LORD, the Holy One in Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Behold, it is come, and it is done, said the Lord GOD; this is the day whereof I have spoken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the hand staves, and the spears, and they shall burn them with fire seven years:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">So that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down any out of the forests; for they shall burn the weapons with fire: and they shall spoil those that spoiled them, and rob those that robbed them, said the Lord GOD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give to Gog a place there of graves in Israel, the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea: and it shall stop the noses of the passengers: and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude: and they shall call it The valley of Hamongog.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of them, that they may cleanse the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Yes, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be to them a renown the day that I shall be glorified, said the Lord GOD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And they shall sever out men of continual employment, passing through the land to bury with the passengers those that remain on the face of the earth, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months shall they search.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And the passengers that pass through the land, when any sees a man’s bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamongog.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah. Thus shall they cleanse the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And, you son of man, thus said the Lord GOD; Speak to every feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, that you may eat flesh, and drink blood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">You shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks, all of them fatted calves of Bashan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And you shall eat fat till you be full, and drink blood till you be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Thus you shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with all men of war, said the Lord GOD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid on them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">So the house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God from that day and forward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity: because they trespassed against me, therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the hand of their enemies: so fell they all by the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have I done to them, and hid my face from them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Now will I bring again the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy on the whole house of Israel, and will be jealous for my holy name;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">After that they have borne their shame, and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they dwelled safely in their land, and none made them afraid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered them out of their enemies’ lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Then shall they know that I am the LORD their God, which caused them to be led into captivity among the heathen: but I have gathered them to their own land, and have left none of them any more there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have poured out my spirit on the house of Israel, said the Lord GOD.</p>
