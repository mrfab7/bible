<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But now thus saith Jehovah, that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel: Fear not, for I have redeemed thee, I have called [thee] by thy name; thou art mine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">When thou passest through the waters, I [will be] with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee; when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned, neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For I [am] Jehovah thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I gave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved thee; and I will give men for thee, and peoples for thy life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Fear not, for I [am] with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from afar, and my daughters from the end of the earth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">every one that is called by my name, and whom I have created for my glory: I have formed him, yea, I have made him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the peoples be assembled: who among them declareth this, or causeth us to hear former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified; or let them hear, and say, [It is] truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and my servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I [am] HE: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I, I [am] Jehovah; and besides me there is no saviour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">It is I that have declared, and have saved, and have shewed, when there was no strange [god] among you; and ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, that I [am] God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Yea, since the day was, I [am] HE, and there is none that delivereth out of my hand: I will work, and who shall hinder it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Thus saith Jehovah, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought all of them down as fugitives, even the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the ships.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I [am] Jehovah, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Thus saith Jehovah, who maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">who bringeth forth chariot and horse, army and power—they lie down together, they shall not rise; they are extinct, they are quenched as tow:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">—Remember not the former things, neither consider the ancient things:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">behold, I do a new thing; now it shall spring forth: shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, rivers in the waste.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The beast of the field shall glorify me, the jackals and the ostriches; for I will give waters in the wilderness, rivers in the waste, to give drink to my people, my chosen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">This people have I formed for myself: they shall shew forth my praise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">—But thou hast not called upon me, Jacob; for thou hast been weary of me, O Israel:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt-offerings, neither hast thou glorified me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to toil with an oblation, nor wearied thee with incense.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices; but thou hast made me to toil with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">—I, I [am] He that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and I will not remember thy sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Put me in remembrance, let us plead together; rehearse thine own [cause], that thou mayest be justified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Thy first father hath sinned, and thy mediators have rebelled against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the ban, and Israel to reproaches.</p>
