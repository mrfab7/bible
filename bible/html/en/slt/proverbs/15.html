<p class="verse" data-verse="1">A soft answer will turn away wrath, and a word of pain will bring up anger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The tongue of the wise will make knowledge good: and the mouth of the foolish will gush forth folly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">In every place are the eyes of Jehovah observing closely the evil and the good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The healing of the tongue the tree of life: and perverseness in it a breaking in the spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The foolish will deride his fatherâ€™s instruction: and he watching reproof will be crafty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The house of the just much treasure: and in the increase of the unjust the being troubled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The lips of the wise will disperse knowledge: and the heart of the foolish not so.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The sacrifice of the unjust an abomination of Jehovah: and the prayer of the upright his acceptance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The way of the unjust an abomination of Jehovah: and he will love him pursuing justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Correction is evil to him forsaking the way: he hating reproof shall die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Hades and destruction are before Jehovah: much more the hearts of the sons of man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">He mocking will not love him reproving him: to the wise he will not go.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">A heart of joy will do the face good: and by pains of heart the spirit was dejected.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The heart of him understanding will seek knowledge: and the face of the foolish will feed folly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">All the days of the afflicted are evil: and the good of heart drinking always.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Good is little with the fear of Jehovah more than much treasure and confusion with it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Good a ration of herbs and love there, above an ox of the stall and hatred with it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">A man of wrath will excite strife: and he slow to anger will appease contention.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The way of the slothful as the cutting of the thorn: and the path of the upright was raised up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">A wise son will gladden the father: and the foolish man despised his mother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Folly is joy to him wanting heart: and the man of understanding will make straight to go.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The frustrating purposes with no counsel, but in the multitude of counselors it shall be set up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Joy to the man in the answer of his mouth: and a word in its time how good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The path of life is above to the understanding one, to depart from hades below.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The house of the proud will Jehovah sweep away, and he will set up the bound of the widow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">The purposes of evil an abomination of Jehovah: and the pure speaking of pleasantness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He plundering plunder troubled his house; and he hating gifts shall live.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">The heart of the just one shall meditate to answer: and the mouth of the unjust shall gush out evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Jehovah is far off from the unjust: and he will hear the prayer of the just.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">From the light of the eyes the heart will rejoice: and a good report will fatten the bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">The ear hearing the reproof of life shall lodge in the midst of the wise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">He driving away instruction despised his soul: and he hearing reproof obtained a heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">The fear of Jehovah the instruction of wisdom; and before honor humility.</p>
