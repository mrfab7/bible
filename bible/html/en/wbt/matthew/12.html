<p class="verse" data-verse="1">At that time Jesus went on the sabbath through the corn, and his disciples were hungry, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, Behold, thy disciples do that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">But he said to them, Have ye not read what David did when he was hungry, and they that were with him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">How he entered into the house of God, and ate the show-bread, which it was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them who were with him, but only for the priests?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Or have ye not read in the law, that on the sabbath the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But I say to you, that in this place is one greater than the temple.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And when he had departed thence, he went into their synagogue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And behold, there was a man who had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath? that they might accuse him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And he said to them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it shall fall into a pit on the sabbath, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">How much then is a man better than a sheep? wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Then saith he to the man, Stretch out thy hand. And he stretched it out; and it was restored to a sound state like the other.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And charged them that they should not make him known:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Behold, my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall show judgment to the Gentiles.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He shall not contend, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he shall send forth judgment to victory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Then was brought to him one possessed with a demon, blind and dumb; and he healed him, so that the blind and dumb both spoke and saw.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This man doth not cast out demons, but by Beelzebub the prince of the demons.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself, is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself, shall not stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And if Satan casteth out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your children expel them? therefore they shall be your judges.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Or else, how can one enter into a strong man’s house, and seize his goods, except he shall first bind the strong man? and then he will plunder his house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">He that is not with me, is against me; and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth abroad.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Wherefore I say to you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven to men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit shall not be forgiven to men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And whoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whoever speaketh against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by its fruit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">A good man, out of the good treasure of the heart, bringeth forth good things: and an evil man, out of the evil treasure, bringeth forth evil things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">But I say to you, That for every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account in the day of judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">But he answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh for a sign, and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale’s belly: so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, a greater than Jonah is here.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and he findeth none.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also to this wicked generation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">While he was yet speaking to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">Then one said to him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">But he answered and said to him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">And he stretched forth his hand towards his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">For whoever shall do the will of my Father who is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.</p>
