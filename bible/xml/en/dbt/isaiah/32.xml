<chapter book="Isaiah" number="32" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And a man shall be as a hiding-place from the wind, and a covert from the storm; as brooks of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a thirsty land.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear shall hearken;</verse>
  <verse number="4">and the heart of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.</verse>
  <verse number="5">The vile man shall be no more called noble, nor the churl said to be bountiful:</verse>
  <verse number="6">for the vile man will speak villainy, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error against Jehovah, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and to cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The instruments also of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the meek with lying words, even when the needy speaketh right.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But the noble deviseth noble things; and to noble things doth he stand.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Rise up, ye women that are at ease, hear my voice; ye careless daughters, give ear unto my speech.</verse>
  <verse number="10">In a year and [some] days shall ye be troubled, ye careless women; for the vintage shall fail, the ingathering shall not come.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless ones; strip you, and make you bare, and gird [sackcloth] on your loins!</verse>
  <verse number="12">They shall smite on the breasts [in lamentation] for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vineyards.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Upon the land of my people shall come up thistles [and] briars, yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For the palace shall be deserted, the multitude of the city shall be forsaken; hill and watchtower shall be caves for ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;</verse>
  <verse number="15">until the Spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness become a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And judgment shall inhabit the wilderness, and righteousness dwell in the fruitful field.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness, quietness and assurance for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting-places.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and the city shall be low in a low place.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth the feet of the ox and the ass.</verse>
