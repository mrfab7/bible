<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Even to day [is] my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Oh that I knew where I might find him! [that] I might come [even] to his seat!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I would order [my] cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I would know the words [which] he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Will he plead against me with [his] great power? No; but he would put [strength] in me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Behold, I go forward, but he [is] not [there]; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold [him]: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see [him]:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But he knoweth the way that I take: [when] he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary [food].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But he [is] in one [mind], and who can turn him? and [what] his soul desireth, even [that] he doeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For he performeth [the thing that is] appointed for me: and many such [things are] with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Because I was not cut off before the darkness, [neither] hath he covered the darkness from my face.</p>
