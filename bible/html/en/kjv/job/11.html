<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For thou hast said, My doctrine [is] pure, and I am clean in thine eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that [they are] double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee [less] than thine iniquity [deserveth].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">[It is] as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The measure thereof [is] longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider [it]?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For vain man would be wise, though man be born [like] a wild assâ€™s colt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If iniquity [be] in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Because thou shalt forget [thy] misery, [and] remember [it] as waters [that] pass away:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And [thine] age shall be clearer than the noonday; thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig [about thee, and] thou shalt take thy rest in safety.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make [thee] afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope [shall be as] the giving up of the ghost.</p>
