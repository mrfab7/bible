<div class="chapter" data-book="John" data-chapter="10" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Truly, truly, I say to you, He that enters not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">But he that enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">To him the porter opens; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And when he puts forth his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">This parable spoke Jesus to them: but they understood not what things they were which he spoke to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Then said Jesus to them again, Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The thief comes not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd gives his life for the sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep, and flees: and the wolf catches them, and scatters the sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The hireling flees, because he is an hireling, and cares not for the sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">As the Father knows me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Therefore does my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">No man takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And many of them said, He has a devil, and is mad; why hear you him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Others said, These are not the words of him that has a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon’s porch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Then came the Jews round about him, and said to him, How long do you make us to doubt? If you be the Christ, tell us plainly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Jesus answered them, I told you, and you believed not: the works that I do in my Father’s name, they bear witness of me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">But you believe not, because you are not of my sheep, as I said to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And I give to them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father’s hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">I and my Father are one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Jesus answered them, Many good works have I showed you from my Father; for which of those works do you stone me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone you not; but for blasphemy; and because that you, being a man, make yourself God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, You are gods?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Say you of him, whom the Father has sanctified, and sent into the world, You blaspheme; because I said, I am the Son of God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">But if I do, though you believe not me, believe the works: that you may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he stayed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">And many resorted to him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spoke of this man were true.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">And many believed on him there.</p>
