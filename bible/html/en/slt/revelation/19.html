<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And after these things I heard the great voice of a vast multitude in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, to the Lord our God:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For true and just his judgments: for he judged the great harlot, who corrupted the earth with her harlotry, and he avenged the blood of his servants from her hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And the second time they said, Alleluia. And her smoke goes up for ever and ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell and worshipped God sitting upon the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And a voice from the throne came out, saying, Praise our God, all his servants, and they fearing him, also small and great.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And I heard as the voice of the vast multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of powerful thunders, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God, the Omnipotent Ruler, reigned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Let us rejoice, and be transported with joy, and let us give glory to him: for the marriage of the Lamb came, and his wife prepared herself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And it was given her that she put on fine linen, pure and shining: for fine linen is the justification of the holy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And he says to me, Write, Happy they called to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he says to me, These are the true words of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And I fell before his feet to worship him. And he says to me, See, not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren having the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he sitting upon him called Faithful and True, and in justice he judges and makes war.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And his eyes as a flame of fire, and upon his head many diadems; having a name written, which no one knows, except himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And surrounded with a garment dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And the armies in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And out of his mouth went forth a sharp sword, that with it he might strike the nations: and he shall rule them with an iron rod: and he treads the winepress of the wine of the wrath and anger of God, the Omnipotent Ruler.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And he has upon the garment and upon his thigh the name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And I saw one angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a great voice, saying to all the birds flying in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves to the supper of the great God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">That ye might eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains of thousands, and the flesh of the strong, and the flesh of horses, and of them sitting upon them, and the flesh of all, free and servants, and of small and great.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And I saw the wild beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to war with him sitting upon the horse, and with his army.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And the wild beast was seized, and with him the false prophet having done signs before him, with which he deceived them having received the stamp of the wild beast, and them worshipping his image. Living, were they two cast into the lake of fire burning with sulphur.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And the rest were killed by the sword of him sitting upon the horse, coming out of his mouth: and all birds were satiated from their flesh.</p>
