<div class="chapter" data-book="Hebrews" data-chapter="1" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">In many places and in many ways, in past times, God spoke to the fathers through the Prophets;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">lastly, in these days, he has spoken to us through the Son, whom he appointed as the heir of all things, and through whom he made the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And since the Son is the brightness of his glory, and the figure of his substance, and is carrying all things by the Word of his virtue, thereby accomplishing a purging of sins, he sits at the right hand of Majesty on high.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And having been made so much better than the Angels, he has inherited a name so much greater than theirs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For to which of the Angels has he ever said: “You are my Son; today have I begotten you?” Or again: “I will be a Father to him, and he shall be a Son to me?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And again, when he brings the only-begotten Son into the world, he says: “And let all the Angels of God adore him.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And about the Angels, certainly, he says: “He makes his Angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But about the Son: “Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. The scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of equity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">You have loved justice, and you have hated iniquity. Because of this, God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of exultation, above your companions.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And: “In the beginning, O Lord, you founded the earth. And the heavens are the work of your hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">These shall pass away, but you will remain. And all will grow old like a garment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And you will change them like a cloak, and they shall be changed. Yet you are ever the same, and your years will not diminish.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But to which of the Angels has he ever said: “Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Are they not all spirits of ministration, sent to minister for the sake of those who shall receive the inheritance of salvation?</p>
